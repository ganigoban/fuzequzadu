The rapper previously brought out an actor who would sit on the couch and pass him his pad as he kicked off the show. However, Sandra’s presence added a personal touch, especially since Drake dedicated “Look What You’ve Done” to his mother and his uncle Steve. After he wrapped up his verse, Sandra Graham began to tear up before the two exchanged a hug.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-amp-sandra-graham-s-moment-nbsp>Drake & Sandra Graham’s Moment&nbsp;</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Drake’s love for his mother has been well-documented throughout his career. Although “Look What You’ve Done” stands as one of his greatest tributes to his mother, the rapper continued to pay homage to her across his discography. On If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, he dived into his relationship with Sandra and his father, Dennis, on the record “You & The 6.” Scorpion highlight, “Sandra’s Rose” similarly reflects their relationship.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Drizzy’s latest concert marks the second of three shows in New York City. The rapper will perform at MSG again tonight (July 26th) before heading off to Washington and Philadelphia to close out the month. Then, he’ll take the tour to Milwaukee and Memphis before performing four nights at the Kia Forum in Inglewood. We’ll keep you posted on anymore updates surrounding Drake’s tour. Check out his heartwarming moment with Sandra Graham above.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bad-bunny-hints-at-for-all-the-dogs-collab>Bad Bunny Hints At "For All The Dogs" Collab</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With Drake confirming that his forthcoming album, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">For All The Dogs</a>, will arrive this summer, fans eagerly await new details surrounding the project. Last week, he unleashed his "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">On The Radar Freestyle</a>" with Central Cee, which could indicate that the UK rapper will appear on the project. However, Drake also hinted that a collaboration with Bad Bunny is on the way. The rapper shared a post from Bad Bunny's Instagram page that read, "Beware Of The Dogs," leading fans to hope that they will come through with a new collaboration to follow "MIA."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.

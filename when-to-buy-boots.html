But instead of adding to your summer collection, it's time to consider what you want your fall wardrobe to look like, since the cooler weather will be here before we know it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, it's a tad early to deck your halls with cozy decor and start scouring Bath & Body Works for pumpkin-scented candles (though, if that's what makes you happy, you do you), but piecing together your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fall outfits</a> can really begin now. As you start drafting next season's shopping list, you'll of course want to include a variety of classics (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>anything plaid</a>) and trendy items (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>graphic tees</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>millennial-style mom jeans</a>) in your cart. But you know that pair of boots you've had bookmarked on your browser forever? Well, we have it on good authority that those should be made a priority, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's no time like the present to invest in a quality pair of boots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We're not just saying that because you more than deserve to treat yourself after the wild ride we've had and continue to endure, either. According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lucila Saldana</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>WGSN</a> Strategist, Footwear and Accessories, the market is being steered in a new direction, and a "buy less, but better" mentality is in the driver's seat.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Saldana tells InStyle that while consumers crave newness, the shift from "more" to "better" will be marked in 2021. It's an interesting paradox: Brands have had to shift their focus from biannual collections to daily product drops to keep up with today's consumers who, thanks in large part to social media, want more options more frequently. But "more" doesn't always mean "better," so in order to best weather this change, it's paramount for shoppers to learn and understand that better — better quality, better design, better functionality — does often coexist with value.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You've heard the age-old phrase "you get what you pay for," right? That's essentially the goal here: To buy less, but buy better quality to get more wear out of your wardrobe. But why the sudden shift in perspective? Saldana says it stems from a culmination of consumers realizing they need fewer items, a more sustainable mindset, and the post-pandemic recession.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Designers are refocusing on considered essentials that have longevity, as products that can stand the test of time will be more important than ever," Saldana says. "As a result, we suggest returning to heritage items and up-speccing accessories designs to promote the endurance of single pieces over multiple buys."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's also where a better boots purchase comes in — think of them as an investment as opposed to a splurge. Rather than spending a small chunk on a new pair of boots every season, now's the time to invest in your dream pair that, while at a higher price point, are also higher quality and will last for years to come.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're still unsure how to determine whether or not the specific pair you've been eyeing is worth purchasing, Saldana offered a few tips to help you out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first is to make sure the design you're leaning towards is timeless and familiar but remastered for your modern lifestyle. Opt for core boots like utility boots, ankle booties, pairs that extend to or over the knee, and styles that are trans-seasonal with longterm appeal. Next, do your research. Find out what materials the boots are made of, prioritizing high-quality materials as well as comfortable styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, buy with resale potential in mind. "We're expecting this market to grow," Saldana tells InStyle. "Therefore, positioning your product as a commodity the customer can invest in and then trade is essential."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3y0tM6eqmivmJq7bsDOZpmusV2XvLDA0g%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Speaking about the former news outlet's former star pundit, <a href=#>Glenn Beck, she's said</a>, "I think that he is frequently ridiculous." Meanwhile, on <a href=#>Twitter</a> in 2021, she wrote about primetime host, Sean Hannity, "[He] is like the guy you don't want to go on a second date with." But&nbsp;Behar has arguably dedicated much of her modern vitriol to Tucker Carlson. Fox's most popular op-ed star in the cable news sphere has often been taken to task by outlets like&nbsp;<a href=#>The New York Times</a>&nbsp;for his purported support of white nationalism.</p><p>Such discussion was only exacerbated in May 2022, when a Buffalo teen who shot more than a dozen people in a store was found to have reportedly kept a manifesto reflecting Carlson's perspectives on critical race theory, per <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>. Behar believed the mainstream media should curb coverage of Carlson's soliloquies. "Just ignore him," <a href=#>she said on "The View."</a> "Every time we talk about him, every time the media gives him air time, he gets bigger and bigger." Her jab came on the heels of another contentious Carlson declaration, this time involving his seemingly <a href=#>initial support for Russian President, Vladimir Putin</a> who spearheaded the country's invasion of Ukraine. "I hope he's planning to move to Moscow, because he's not gonna be welcome here for much longer," <a href=#>Behar retorted</a> on "The View."&nbsp;</p><p>If you have been impacted by incidents of mass violence, or are experiencing emotional distress related to incidents of mass violence, you can call or text <a href=#>Disaster Distress Helpline</a> at 1-800-985-5990 for support.</p><p>If you or a loved one has experienced a hate crime, contact the VictimConnect Hotline by phone at 1-855-4-VICTIM or <a href=#>by chat</a> for more information or assistance in locating services to help.

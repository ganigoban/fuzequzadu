And just like Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato and Selena&nbsp;Gomez before her, she managed to parlay her child success into adulthood, appearing opposite Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron in musical phenomenon&nbsp;The Greatest Showman and playing Tom Holland's love interest MJ&nbsp;in the third big screen incarnation of Spider-Man.</p><p>Zendaya has also finished <a href=#>runner-up on</a> <a href=#>Dancing with the Stars</a>, reached the <a href=#>Billboard 200</a> with her self-titled debut album and <a href=#>lent her voice</a> to animations Duck Duck Goose and Smallfoot. But perhaps her most impressive, and audacious, career move came in 2019 when she signed up to play the drug-addicted teen Rue Bennett in HBO's teen drama-that's-not-actually-for-teens, <a href=#>Euphoria</a>. At just 24 years old, Zendaya became the <a href=#>youngest ever recipient</a> of the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her acclaimed performance. She's since added to her filmography with a co-starring turn in black and white two-hander Malcolm and Marie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxkbX5ye8WapKito2Kzoq%2FErGStoJGperix0Z5kqKaTmnqquoykoJ2yXZe8sXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

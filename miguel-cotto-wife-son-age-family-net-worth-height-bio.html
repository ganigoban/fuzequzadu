He will be remembered in the boxing world as the first Puerto Rican to win world titles in four weight classes.&nbsp;Miguel was at the peak of his powers between 2007 and 2009, which was proven by his impressive number seven ranking in pound for pound for pound by The Ring Magazine.</span></p><p><span>Miguel Cotto was born on the 29th&nbsp;</span><span>day</span><span>&nbsp;of October 1980 in Rhode Island to Puerto Rican parents.&nbsp;Before the age of two, Miguel had to move to Caguas, Puerto Rico.&nbsp;You could say that the boxing genes were very present in his family with many of his boxing-related relatives.&nbsp;His late father Miguel Cotto Snr, his first cousin Abner Cotto, his former boxing trainer and his uncle Evangelista Cotto and his brother Jose Miguel Cotto were all boxers with varying degrees of success.</span></p><p><span>Miguel started his career as a hard hitter and pressure fighter, but over the years he evolved into a more calculated and refined boxer/puncher as he moved up the weight classes.&nbsp;Miguel as a child was fat and started boxing mainly to lose weight.&nbsp;At this point, he never imagined boxing would become a career path.</span></p><p><span>He was taken by his uncle to Bairoa Gym in Caguas where young Cotto became an amateur fighter.&nbsp;His career kicked off when he defeated former world title contender John Brown in the tenth round by decision.&nbsp;Cotto had been given a career scare when he suffered a career injury in 2001 on his way to a gym at 5 a.m.&nbsp;He had broken his arm and needed to be hospitalized to fully recover.</span></p><p><span>Cotto ended his boxing career with a total number of 47 fights and 41 wins.&nbsp;Of the 41 wins, 33 by knockout, which left Cotto with 6 career losses.&nbsp;Cotto was widely regarded as Puerto Rico’s greatest sporting export and is considered one of his country’s top boxers alongside Wilfredo Gomez, Felix Trinidad, Wilfred Benitez, Hector Camacho and Carlos Ortiz.</span></p><p><span>One of Miguel Cotto’s most notable duels was his fight against Antonio Margarito, it ended in a bloody defeat for Cotto.&nbsp;During the ensuing fight between Margarito and Shane Mosley, officials discovered that his hands were covered in a charged substance believed to be plaster of paris.&nbsp;It’s widely believed that Margarito used the same trick to earn his win over Miguel Cotto.</span></p><p><span>Three and a half years later, Miguel was stung against Margarito in the second defense of his WBA title and this time Miguel got his revenge brutally.&nbsp;Margarito had been shot in the right eye a year earlier during his fight with Manny Pacquiao.&nbsp;In one of the bloodiest fights of all time, Miguel took revenge only on Margarito’s right eye, leaving it bloody and swollen.&nbsp;Margarito had to stop fighting for more than four years to recover from the damage caused.</span></p><p><span>When he retired from professional and competitive boxing, Miguel built and ran a boxing promotion called “Promociones Miguel Cotto”.&nbsp;The agency sets up combat maps but with the geographic constraint of only operating in Puerto Rico.</span></p><p><span>He also created a non-profit organization called “El Angel” which promotes physical activity as well as measures against the infant fat he suffered from.</span></p><p><strong><span>Also Read: Floyd Mayweather’s Girlfriend, Wife, Daughters, Children, Mother</span></strong></p><h2><strong><span>The wife, sons and family of Miguel Cotto</span></strong></h2><p><span>He is married to a lady he has described as the love of his life, although he has had previous relationships.&nbsp;Cotto married Melissa Guzman in 1998 and the couple were blessed with three children.</span></p><p><span>They named their first daughter Alondra Cotto and their second child and first son after himself Miguel Cotto III.&nbsp;His last son is Luiz Cotto.&nbsp;The marriage was a bit chaotic when it was discovered that Cotto had had an extramarital affair which reportedly had a daughter born in November 2006.</span></p><p><span>Cotto’s brother Jose Cotto was a boxer who sadly passed away on January 3rd&nbsp;</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;2010. His mother’s name is Juana Vasquez.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Miguel Cotto has been at the top of the boxing pyramid for almost two decades, which suggests he would have benefited monetarily.&nbsp;Miguel has a net worth of $25 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height, body measurement</span></strong></h2><p><span>Miguel Angel Cotto Vasquez, nicknamed Junito, stands 5 feet 7 inches tall and is 170 cm tall.&nbsp;It has a reach of 67 which is 170 cm.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGilmZzCpriMnKatrJ9ixKqyxGaqqKZdlrSmecWapKKkqWK7psCMsKarrJhitaa1xqGrZpqZpHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

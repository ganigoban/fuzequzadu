If you were black, white, Mexican, Asian, Muslim, educated, poor or rich, if you were a woman, it did not matter. Less than 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote. Look how far we've come from having no voice to being on the brink of making history again by electing the first woman president. Yes! But we have to vote. The world looks to us as a progressive country that leads change. Eight years ago, I was so inspired to know that my nephew, a young black child, could grow up knowing his dreams could be realized by witnessing a black president in office. And now we have the opportunity to create more change. I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country, and know that her possibilities are limitless. We have to think about the future of our daughters, our sons, and vote for someone who cares for them as much as we do. And that is why I'm with her. If you are ready for freedom, make some noise.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Queen Bey closed out the show with a performance of "Formation" and "Freedom." And the best part?

In a nutshell: In December 2019, Lyssa <a href=#>accused</a> former&nbsp;Dog the Bounty Hunter co-star Justin Bihag of attempting to steal Beth Chapman's ashes to supposedly sell on eBay. Somehow, her rage got redirected toward Angell in the process, slamming her on Twitter as a "disgusting" person. "Any person who moves in on a man weeks after losing his wife, who you were supposed to be a 'friend' to, Is the lowest scum on the planet," she <a href=#>railed</a>, before adding in another <a href=#>tweet</a>,&nbsp;"Let's not forget how you came to know my family because you were with my BROTHER. NOW TRYING TO FET WITH MY DAD. BARFFFFFFF."&nbsp;</p><p>Lyssa told fans she has since blocked her nemesis, and it looks like Angell has deleted her replies to Duane Chapman's daughter, but a screenshot of one exchange (via <a href=#>YourTango</a>) does shed some light on Angell's feelings about the situation. Angell called Lyssa "thirsty for attention" and accused her of "ruining"&nbsp;Duane's life thanks to her "drunk a**." Sigh.</p><p>Unfortunately, it looks there won't be a fresh start between these two in 2020 because Lyssa slammed Angell again on Jan. 6.&nbsp;"My arsenal is stacked with info, ex's, restraining orders, trust funds thefts," she ominously <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "5 men in 3 years ... I got the proof. I got the big guns. Make me use em'.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanBiaYJ1e9ahsGacn5x6tbTEZpmorZ6pxm601KernqqjYrGiwcahq56qXZ7Abr%2FLmqSmoZ6ceqm10malnq9dnLazuMWroJ6mlGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

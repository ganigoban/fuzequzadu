Rihanna is set to headline the iconic Super Bowl halftime show for the first time ever - and her performance has been choreographed by none other than NZ’s own Parris Goebel.
Rihanna turned down the chance to headline the show in 2019 in support of Colin Kaepernick, who was ousted from the NFL for protesting police brutality."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We far from home but we made it!!!! I love you 4L. Let’s do this sis.”</p><p>Kiwi dancers are also expected to be part of the performance, as Goebel heads up dance crews ReQuest and The Royal Family.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>And it’s not the first time Goebel has done this - in 2020, she choreographed Jennifer Lopez’s historic Super Bowl performance, viewed by 1.2 million people and earning Goebel the title of “the Super Bowl’s hidden M.V.P.” from the New York Times.</p><p>As for what we can expect from Rihanna’s setlist, that’s also a secret - but with countless hits to her name, we can guess several will feature in the 13-minute performance.</p><p>We could see <i>Umbrella</i>, <i>Diamonds</i>, <i>Only Girl (In the World)</i> or <i>B**ch Better Have My Money</i> get a run.</p><p>Calvin Harris could appear as a guest for <i>We Found Love</i> or <i>This is What You Came For</i>, while Drake could pop up for <i>Work</i> and <i>What’s My Name</i>.</p><p>The pop star has promised a “jam-packed show” in what will be her first live performance in seven years.</p><p>“When you become a mom, there’s something that just happens where you feel like you can take on the world, you can do anything. The Super Bowl is one of the biggest stages of the world,” Rihanna said ahead of the show.</p><p>“There’s something exhilarating about the challenge of it all. Deciding how to maximise 13 minutes but also celebrate — that’s what this show is going to be. It’s going to be a celebration of my catalogue in the best way that we could have put it together.”</p><p>The nine-time Grammy winner has 14 No.1 Billboard Hot 100 hits to her name. She also recently welcomed her first child with rapper A$AP Rocky.</p><p>As for the rest of the performances during the halftime show, Chris Stapleton will sing the US national anthem and R&B star Babyface will sing <i>America the Beautiful</i>.</p><p>And while New Zealand viewers may not see them live, the tradition of airing extra special TV adverts during halftime will continue in the US.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The likes of Netflix and Google are paying up to NZ$11m for a 30-second ad spot during the game to get the views from around 100 million people tuning in.</p><p>The ads seen so far include cameos from John Travolta and <i>Scrubs</i> stars Zach Braff and Donald Faison singing a version of<i> Summer Nights</i> from <i>Grease</i> for T-Mobile.</p><p>Meanwhile, we see several versions of Adam Driver in an ad for Squarespace and Alicia Silverstone reprising her <i>Clueless</i> character for online shopping site Rakuten.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Where to watch the 2023 Super Bowl halftime show</h2><p>The game itself kicks off at 12:30pm NZT.

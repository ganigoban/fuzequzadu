He gained recognition for his daring attempts to imitate the outrageous stunts seen on the popular television series “Jackass.” One of Vonmar’s most widely circulated pranks was the “Put Em’ in a Coffin” stunt, where participants would hurl themselves onto flat surfaces or crowded tables, mimicking lying in a coffin.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>The Vine video featuring the “Put Em’ in a Coffin” prank went viral back in 2014, amassing an impressive 2.9 million views, 62,300 likes, and 62,000 shares. This craze led others to replicate the stunt online, using hashtags such as #PutEmInACoffin and #PutEmInTheCoffin. However, Vonmar’s involvement in the prank led to legal trouble in 2015 when he was arrested and charged for performing it at a 7-Eleven store.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-legal-troubles>Legal Troubles</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>On New Year’s Day of 2015, Vonmar and a companion entered a 7-Eleven store and executed the “Put Em’ in a Coffin” stunt.

In the grainy black-and-white photo accompanying his final felicitation, the smiling brothers pose, Alex's arm draped across Eddie's shoulders. The conspicuous lack of their characteristic humongous hair reveals it was clearly not taken in the 1980s. "Happy Birthday Al! Love ya!!," reads the post, followed by a slew of hashtags, including: "#vanhalen #alexvanhalen #drummer #family #rock #rockband," and lastly, "#love."</p><p>The older of the rock-and-roll brothers, <a href=#>Alex Van Halen</a> was born on May 8, 1953, making him 67 years old when little brother Eddie died at 65 from the throat cancer that he fought tooth-and-nail for over a decade. <a href=#>According to The Hollywood Reporter</a>, both brothers were born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and immigrated to the United States with their parents in 1962. The family moved to Pasadena, California, where they founded their big-haired hard rock band that shot to the top of the charts with their first single, a cover of "You Really Got Me" by <a href=#>The Kinks</a>, which miffed Eddie, <a href=#>according to iHeart Radio</a>. ("Jamie's Cryin'" would have been their debut single had Eddie had his way.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BlHFtbGxfqbWqv4ywmKxllZmxqrGMr5inZZiWuaa60madoqaRoXq0u8KimKVlnZqxqq2MqaasrF2pvG60yKxkm6qfqbWmvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

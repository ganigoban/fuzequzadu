Amazon has described the synopsis by saying “Elle follows Elle Woods in high school as we learn about the life experiences that shaped her into the iconic young woman we came to know and love in the first film.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eFedYS65rAu data-wc=84>Reese Witherspoon, who embodied Elle Woods in the movie, has said in a statement that “Fans will get to know how Elle Woods navigated her world as a teenager with her distinct personality and ingenuity, in ways that only our beloved Elle could do. What could be better than that? I’m extremely grateful to the incredible teams at Prime Video and Hello Sunshine — along with our amazing writer Laura Kittrell — for making this dream of mine come true. Legally Blonde is back!”</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eIKZMbyvIwp data-wc=71>Just yesterday Reese took to her Instagram account to share her excitement, posting a video of herself getting dressed into a bright Dolce & Gabbana pink tweed twinset, captioning the post “Before she became the most famous Gemini vegetarian to graduate from Harvard Law, she was just a regular ‘90s high school girl.

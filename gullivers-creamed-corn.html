This recipe comes from a restaurant that was famous for its creamed corn. It was passed on to our family and we’ve loved it ever since.</p><p>I will say that the most popular side dishes at our huge Thanksgiving dinner has to be this creamed corn recipe and my <a href=#>sweet potato casserole</a>. They are always the first to go!</p><p>My creamed corn recipes were a hit last year on Modern Honey! You can also try my <a href=#>Bacon Creamed Corn</a> or my <a href=#>Southwest Creamed Corn</a> recipes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Creamed-Corn-Ingredients.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What ingredients are in Creamed Corn?</h2><p>Gulliver’s Creamed Corn is made with simple ingredients – corn, cream, butter, sugar, salt, parmesan cheese and even topped with crispy bacon. &nbsp;How can you go wrong? It is the first thing the kids devour at our Thanksgiving!&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Frozen Corn — you can choose white corn or yellow corn in this recipe.</li><li><strong>Butter</strong> — use salted butter in this recipe.</li><li><strong>Heavy Cream</strong> — this makes the creamiest creamed corn known to man! But if you want a thinner creamed corn, you can use half-n-half. As the creamed corn cools, it will thicken so you can always add more cream, half-n-half, or a touch of whole milk.</li><li><strong>Flour</strong> — this helps to thicken the creamed corn.</li><li><strong>Salt</strong> — the salt amount will vary depending on if you use salted or unsalted butter in this recipe.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong> — just a touch of sugar and just a bit of sweetness to this creamed corn recipe.</li><li><strong>Parmesan Cheese</strong> — I suggest freshly grating parmesan cheese because it melts so much better than pre-packed shredded parmesan cheese.</li></ul><p>If you want a more savory creamed corn, add crispy bacon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Creamed-Corn-Recipe-2-crop-scaled.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make the Best Creamed Corn:</h2><li><strong>The first thing you want to do is cook the corn</strong>. You want to slightly undercook it as it will continue to cook once it is added to the ingredients. You can use fresh or frozen corn. I use frozen corn every single time and it is perfect.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Start off by making a paste with butter, flour, sugar, and salt</strong>. Add the finely grated parmesan cheese. Stir in cooked corn.</li><li><strong>Add heavy cream and let it simmer on medium-low until it thickens</strong>. Check for seasonings and add pepper if you so desire. Serve warm.&nbsp;</li><p>To make Gulliver’s Creamed Corn, I use frozen corn because it’s so much easier. Using fresh corn kernels is another great option. I love to buy the frozen corn at Costco but any brand will work out well. The corn is cooked ahead of time and then added to a butter and parmesan cheese paste. The heavy cream is added and cooked until thickened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Creamed-Corn-Recipe-1-crop-scaled.jpg><p>My kids love this so much that just recently I made it for the family and had some leftovers in the refrigerator. My daughter was putting together a lemonade stand with her friend and asked if she could sell the creamed corn because that way she could make “a ton of money because it’s the best thing ever.” I somehow convinced her that selling popcorn might be a better idea.</p><p>If you are a huge bacon lover, then top this Gulliver’s Creamed Corn with crispy bacon. I found that ensuring that the bacon is extra crispy will allow it to stand up against the creamed corn.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What to serve with Creamed Corn:</h2><p>Creamed corn is such a delicious side dish that pairs well with a variety of main courses, from grilled chicken to grilled steaks to turkey or simply served as a comforting stand-alone dish.</p><p>Making it from scratch is relatively simple, and the taste is well worth the effort. Whether you’re preparing it for a holiday gathering or a weeknight dinner, homemade creamed corn will surely be a hit at your table.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More Side Dish Recipes:</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Pin on Pinterest:</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Creamed-Corn-Recipe.jpg><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=3765 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/gullivers-creamed-corn/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=7><li id=wprm-recipe-12609-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=-1><p>Cook corn according to package instructions.</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-12609-step-0-1 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=5><p>In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-low heat.

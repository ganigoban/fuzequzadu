I was doing it for 11 years, but there is a lot of controversy going on right now."</p><p dir=ltr>When he seemingly vanished from the show in 2020, the picker says he was out for a couple of reasons. The first is the back surgery, in which he had metal rods inserted into his spine (via <a href=#>Outsider</a>). Years of riding around in a van can do that to you. Then, he mentions that the COVID-19 pandemic hit and things really got messed up. Fritz has Crohn's disease, and according to <a href=#>WebMD</a>, people with Crohn's have a chance of having worse outcomes with the virus because some of the drugs prescribed to treat Crohn's lower the immune system, preventing the body from attacking itself.</p><p dir=ltr>Even with those understandable reasons for Frank being gone from the show, he said it would be up to the network if he'd be coming back, but it really looks doubtful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAl21saW1flrqmvsicmKdloJ6wrLHRrGSwoJGperixza1ksKqfo7RursStrp6dnmK6qrfEZq6opJaaeqK6w2adq5meoHqnvsitsWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

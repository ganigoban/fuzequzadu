Meanwhile, Jermaine&nbsp;Jackson's relevance had faded substantially; overall, he did fairly well as a solo artist, but by the late '80s, he was primarily known as the most successful Jackson brother not named Michael, which isn't saying much.</p><p>As he prepared for the making of his fourth solo album on Arista Records, Jermaine's prospects for a career renaissance looked good. Arista head Clive Davis hired a pair of talented young producers, Kenneth "Babyface"&nbsp;Edmonds and Antonio "L.A."&nbsp;Reid, to work with the singer. However, Davis claimed in his memoir "Soundtrack of My Life"&nbsp;that this was the last straw for Michael, who was unhappy enough as it is that Jermaine had a few hits on Arista that did decently on the <a href=#>Billboard</a>&nbsp;singles charts. In retaliation, MJ allegedly got Edmonds and Reid to work on his own projects, as cited by <a href=#>Showbiz411</a>.</p><p>"Jermaine couldn't believe that Michael, his close brother, would hijack his producers' material this way,"&nbsp;Davis wrote, adding that Jermaine was "crying, indeed sobbing at times, so deeply hurt that his brother would do this to him."&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, that album, "You Said,"&nbsp;was released in 1991 (via <a href=#>AllMusic</a>) and was still co-produced by Edmonds and Reid under their then-Arista imprint, LaFace. And it was the penultimate track on that record where Jermaine let out all his brotherly angst toward his far more famous sibling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAlm5rcXFfnru0tcOeZK2glWLAqq7LoqWgZaKew6K40bJkm52krLKmuoymoJygkZq5bq3NnWSjnaKirqq6xGahmpubqLyvew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

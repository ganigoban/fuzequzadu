But much debate has been occurring on social media about who might have ended the relationship.
Kyle and Alyssa were a part of the Big Brother 24 cast, where they struck up a showmance inside the game.
Though they broke up and had some drama in the house, the duo got back together after Taylor Hale was named the winner."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A post was made on Twitter from user SpoilerGirl1, which stated just that, leading to a response from a fan who said that he got a Cameo video from Alyssa.</p><p>That fan stated that Alyssa had implied that Kyle wanted to end things. He also noted that Alyssa was supposed to be visiting Utah for a visit, where she would have spent some time with Kyle’s family. That visit didn’t end up taking place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Big-Brother-Fan-On-Showmance.jpg><p>Much conjecture has also been posted, with some fans speculating that Kyle’s mother may not have liked Alyssa. None of these statements about Kyle’s mother have provided any evidence that they are correct, but that hasn’t stopped the online debates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BB-Fan-On-Kyle-And-Alyssa.jpg><p>Taking the conjecture one step further, another fan suggested that Kyle might have proposed to Alyssa on vacation, and her answer may have led to the relationship coming to a close.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BB-Fan-About-Kyle.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More Big Brother news</h2><p>In additional news about Big Brother showmances, the relationship between Tyler Crispen and Angela Rummans ended.</p><p>Recently, <a href=#>Angela shared a video updating fans</a> on what she has been up to and why she moved to Bali.</p><p>That was followed by <a href=#>Tyler talking about his depression</a> and what he has been doing to return to his old self.</p><p>It won’t be too much longer until a new group of houseguests is playing the game and new showmances possibly start to form.

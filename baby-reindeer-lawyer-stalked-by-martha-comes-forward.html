Laura had offered ‘Martha’ a work trial at her company. She told the Daily Mail: “It brought so many things back to me that I'd forgotten. She did the same to me, made my life a nightmare. He has got her spot-on. His reaction was exactly the same as mine. I felt sorry for her.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Netflix’s Baby Reindeer is based on a true story</figure><p id=e10DX1D6ldzj data-wc=71>“She told me a real hard-luck story about how she had no family support and how she got her law degree and was looking for a traineeship, but nobody would give her one. I had my reservations. She was terribly upfront, telling me all this very personal stuff. Before we even met, she sent me a postcard congratulating me on my engagement to Jimmy. But basically, I felt sorry for her.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bb8355050847-snapinstaapp4076137466637352259096768446687402219188683n1080.jpg><p id=eRnKOwxp3FJO data-wc=36>She revealed that she eventually asked ‘Martha’ to leave after she was rude at work, hit another member of staff with a book and had been recommending other solicitors to potential clients while manning the phones.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSl4frHB-nMw data-wc=84>Speaking about when she let ‘Martha’ go she said: “I fired her after a week. She was furious and threatened that she'd do this, that and the other to me… She started shouting, 'Jimmy Wray will rue the day’. Some of the girls in the office were shaking and upset and thought she was going to attack me or some of the other staff. Eventually, she was escorted out, still calling me vile names, and was later spotted circling the office in her car.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer’s ‘real’ Martha denies stalking Richard Gadd: ‘I'm the victim here’" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/cbd6a2c58f7a-martha-baby-reindeer.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer’s ‘real’ Martha denies stalking Richard Gadd: ‘I'm the victim here’" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Baby Reindeer’s ‘real’ Martha denies stalking Richard Gadd: ‘I'm the victim here’</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer: what Richard Gadd has said about the real ‘Darrien’" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8d249b39eb2c-br105unit00203rt.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer: what Richard Gadd has said about the real ‘Darrien’" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Baby Reindeer: what Richard Gadd has said about the real ‘Darrien’</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ep-vJ1rUn2Bk data-wc=42>‘Martha’ then began following Laura, who had started a course at the University of Strathclyde, into her lectures, but the university did nothing at the time.

Every age, every person likes to have fun. We try to have something for everybody. Whether you’re doing a birthday party or you just want to go on a date and have a place to go, when you come in, we want it to feel like we built it just for you,” Hatton added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/02/malibu-jacks-pic-1-2.jpg><p>It features go-karts, a roller coaster, laser tag, mini golf, bowling, arcade games, and a restaurant and bar.</p><p>“What really differentiates us is not only the variety of things you can do but the variety of trips you can take,” said Malibu Jack’s Supervisor Mark Ogden. “Either a short trip just for a quick ride on the roller coaster or on the go-karts. You can spend hours and hours with your family and have a great time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/02/malibu-jacks-pic-2.jpg><p>Employees at Malibu Jack’s say showing off the finished product cannot come soon enough.</p><p>“We feel like it works out really well for families to have access to a park like this when they don’t need to drive three or four hours to go to a supersized, large amusement park,” said Ogden. “We’re just excited to get open as quick as we can and welcome the public into the building.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJ2upqNiwrF5zZ6uZqGembywvoytn56llWK9or7KZqqerF2pvG67z56lZqufpLtutc1mmZ6spJq7pbvRn2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

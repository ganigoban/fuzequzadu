However, this may not leave you with much time to finalise table plans and other key details of the day once guests have RSVP'd or you may find that people already have other plans at shorter notice, so it could be a good idea to send them earlier.</p><p id=exDz1umkyF6o0 data-wc=26><strong>Planning your wedding?

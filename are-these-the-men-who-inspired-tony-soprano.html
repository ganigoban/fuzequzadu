They operated in his neighborhood. He grew up in North Caldwell, next door to Essex Fells." "The Boot" allegedly got his nickname from stomping his victims to death. It was his son, Anthony ("Tony Boy"), with whom the senior Soprano has the most in common (per <a href=#>North Jersey</a>).</p><p>Much like the Soprano head honcho, "Tony Boy" also saw a therapist while actively engaged in mob activity, which was a controversial and sensitive move for a man in a high-ranking crime syndicate. Among other parallels, the elder Boiardo had a lieutenant by the name of&nbsp;John "Big Pussy" Russo, with whom he was close. For those who have seen the show, the similarity in name and rank between Russo and one of the more prominent "Sopranos" personalities, Salvatore "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero (Vincent Pastore), is the smoking gun (so to speak) connection. The conglomeration of antics and various tidbits drawn from the Boiardos is all too apparent in Tony Soprano's story. For those who have taken a second glance at their history in conjunction with the HBO series, they can see full well that it really is all in the family (via North Jersey).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDlmpvbm9flr%2BmedOhnKydXam1pnnMnqVmr5ikeqq60qmgq52UYsGwuthmqqioopa7sHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

MJ was the major breadwinner for his extended family and the sole guardian of his three children, Prince Jackson, Paris Jackson, and Blanket Jackson. While Michael's parents and siblings depended on him for financial support, his kids relied on him for everything.</p><p><a href=#>Michael was a protective dad</a>, rarely allowing his children to be seen in public without disguises. He was also doting, loving, and adored by his children. A year after their father's death, Prince and Paris were interviewed on <a href=#>Oprah</a>. Paris said, "I kind of felt like no one understood what a good father he was. He was the best cook ever. He was just a normal dad." The day their father died, amid the chaos, the kids reportedly ran to chef Kai Chase for comfort, who described the scene to <a href=#>ABC News</a>.&nbsp;"We stood in a circle and we held hands together, and...you feel helpless."&nbsp;</p><p>Michael's mother, Katherine&nbsp;Jackson, <a href=#>told Oprah Winfrey</a>, "You know what broke my heart more than anything else in this world? When people at the hospital told us, 'You can leave now,' and Paris said, 'Grandma, where are we going?'" The kids went to live with Katherine, and youngest child Blanket (who now prefers to be called Bigi) was adopted by his uncle, Tito Jackson, when Katherine grew too frail to care for him full time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGpgaX52e8inqqKclWLBqbGMraman5mYeqe1zZqjZqWfo8Gpv4yonWalmZi1orHLZqGam5uovK97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

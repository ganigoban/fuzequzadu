Several years ago, we embarked on our annual summer trip to California. We played on the beach every day, soaked in the sun and enjoyed the cool ocean breeze. At the end of our trip, several of my brothers and their families were driving up to San Francisco to explore the city for 3-4 days before heading home and they convinced us to join them."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We played on the beach every day, soaked in the sun and enjoyed the cool ocean breeze. At the end of our trip, several of my brothers and their families were driving up to San Francisco to explore the city for 3-4 days before heading home and they convinced us to join them.</p><p>It was an incredibly spontaneous idea but the thought of going home to 115-degree weather made the decision easy. Unfortunately, my husband had to head back to work so I was on my own. I loaded my Yukon with my 4 kids, all of our luggage, and headed up the coast. Since it was a last-minute decision and around the 4th of July, hotels were booked. I ended up in a sold-out hotel in a town outside of the city.</p><p id=yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1480782863123_152343><span id=yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1480782863123_152341>Every day we would make the trek into the city in our over-sized SUV, struggle to find a parking space, then explore the city all day long. I promised them if they got along with each other then our first stop would be the Ghirardelli Chocolate shop. I told each of my kids to pick out their favorite Ghirardelli Chocolate Square flavor. They were hooked and craved them every day and I found that chocolate was quite the motivator! Every time we go back to San Fran, the first thing my kids want to do is to hit the Ghirardelli Chocolate store. Man alive, they are smart children.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0200-2-copy.jpg alt="Ghirardelli Squares Chocolate Cookies.

As soon as the holiday flavors came out, I went straight to Target and bought a bag of the holiday Ghirardelli squares. As I was eating one, I thought how incredible it would be to combine it with a cookie. I played around with it and sure enough it came out just as I hoped it would.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DSC_0210-2-copy.jpg alt="Ghirardelli Squares Chocolate Cookies.

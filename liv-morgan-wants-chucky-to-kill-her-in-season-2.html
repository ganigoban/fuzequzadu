The Chucky revival was a hit and it’s only a matter of time before season two comes at fans. Liv Morgan wants to be a part of that.
Complex recently spoke to Liv Morgan where she opened up about her interest in getting involved in the Chucky show. She would love to be a part of season 2, even if it’s just to be another body for the demented doll to shove a knife in."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’m definitely interested. I feel whenever the timing’s right, the perfect opportunity will appear. Right now, I’m so focused on my work in WWE and winning that RAW Women’s Championship, but I definitely have goals for the future. I’d love to be in Season 2 of Chucky. I’d love to be killed off in a little cameo.”</p><p>We’ll have to see if Liv Morgan gets that cameo on Chucky. Her participation could certainly do a lot when it comes to getting interest on Chucky. Morgan might also find herself playing in a breakout performance down the line.</p><p><b>What’s your take on this story?

These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ye5BqZmtoX6G2t3nMqKmgmZ5ixKK606xknKClmLi6edOoZKShnKF6qbHRZqCnZaOarrS7zWZpaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

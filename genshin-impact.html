The event consists of a number of different activities, including Theater Mechanicus, All That Glitters, Lantern Rite Tales, Festival Fever, Xiao Market, crafting Xiao Lanterns, and more. It’s all pretty complex and a little hard to follow. There’s bound to be some confusion among players. So, to clear things up, here’s our <strong>Lantern Rite Genshin Impact</strong> guide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2021/02/lantern-rite-genshin-impact-640x371.webp><h2>Lantern Rite All That Glitters in Genshin Impact</h2><p>To unlock the All That Glitters part of the Genshin Impact Lantern Rite event, you have to complete the Xiao’s story quest “Alatus Chapter” during the Rite period. The storyline will be divided into three parts: “The Origin of the Lanterns,” “Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns,” and “Light Upon the Sea. The timetable of these steps is available below. Your rewards for completing quests in All That Glitters include Primogems, Hero’s Wit, Mora, and more. You can track your progress via either the Lantern Rite event page or the Quest interface.</p>';document.getElementById("serge_5f895c6208f81a315320ec57").style.display = "block"; }<ul><li>“The Origin of the Lanterns” Quest: 2021/02/10 10:00 – 2021/02/28 03:59</li><li>“Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns” Quest: 2021/02/14 04:00 – 2021/02/28 03:59</li><li>“Light Upon the Sea” Quest: 2021/02/18 04:00 – 2021/02/28 03:59</li></ul><h2>Stand By Me in Lantern Event Genshin Impact</h2><p>The Stand By Me part of the Genshin Impact Lantern Rite event is a sub-event of sorts that lasts between 2021/02/10 10:00 and 2021/03/07 03:59. It allows you to unlock a four-star Liyue character of your choice, if you meet the requirements. You’ll be able to pick between Xiangling, Beidou, Chongyun, Ningguang, Xinyan and Xingqiu.</p><p>Now, I hear you asking, what are the requirements to earn this free character? Well, the first one is to reach the “Glow of a Thousand Lanterns” stage of Festive Fever (more on that in a bit). The second thing you have to do is spend 1000 Peace Talismans in the Xiao Market. You earn these by playing Theater Mechanicus.</p><h2>Lantern Rite Tales & Festive Fever</h2><p>Genshin Impact Lantern Rite Tales are requests that you get from citizens during the festival, and completing them earns you Primogems, Mora, and Festive Fever. You first have to complete “The Origin of the Lanterns” to unlock the tales. They are split into three parts, and you need to collect Festive Fever and complete all relevant tales to unlock the later ones. You can keep track of your progress in the event page.</p><p>Collecting Festive Fever also has three stages (amount and current stage also available in event page): “We’ve Only Just Begun,” “Guests Flock From Afar,” and “Glow of a Thousand Lanterns.” When you reach a certain stage of Festive Fever and complete all the relevant Lantern Rite Tales, you unlock the next stage of the Lantern Rite, which grants access to new “Lantern Rite Tales” and “Theater Mechanicus” sections.</p><h2>Genshin Impact Theater Mechanicus</h2><p>The Theater Mechanicus challenge in the Lantern Rite event in Genshin Impact unlocks after you’ve completed “The Origin of the Lanterns” and “Liyue: Theater Mechanicus.” You can see the duration of Theater below. Each quest you complete in Theater Mechanicus will reward you with Peace Talismans that you can spend in Xiao Market (explained in more detail below).</p><p>After you unlock Theater Mechanicus, go and find Ruijin in Liyue Harbor. They’ve invented a new board game that you can ask to play. Every time you do, you’ll have to spend one Xiao Lantern (also explained more below), regardless of whether you succeed or not. You can either do the challenges solo, or in co-op with one more player.</p><p>The objective of Theater Mechanicus in Genshin Impact Lantern Rite is to eliminate as many monsters as possible by placing Mechanici on the board strategically and using the environment. Basically, monsters come out of purple portals and walk towards blue portals on preset paths; if they reach them, they leave the board. They won’t attack you, but you can’t attack them either; the only way is to use Mechanici. The objective is to let as little monsters as possible escape.</p><p>Each stage allows for only a certain number of monsters to leave. If you let more than that go, you will fail the challenge and the stage ends immediately. At the end of each stage, you’ll earn Veneficus Sigil based on how well you did. You use those for unlocking and upgrading Mechanici. Also, progressing through Festive Fever unlocks more Stages, Mechanici, higher upgrade levels, and increased difficulty levels.</p><ul><li>2021/02/10 10:00 – 2021/03/07 03:59</li></ul><h2>Xiao Market Genshin Impact Lantern Rite Event</h2><p>The Xiao Market part of the Lantern Rite event in Genshin Impact will have three stages, which will start on the first, fifth, and ninth day of the event, respectively. You can see their start and end dates and times below. In the Xiao Market, you can use the Pecae Talismans you’ve accumulated to purchase a variety of rewards. These include the namecard style “Celebration: Lantern-Light,” Character Enhancement Materials, Hero’s Wit, Mystic Enhancement Ore, Talent Level-Up Materials, the Crown of Insight, etc. Different items will be available in each of the three stages, so keep an eye out.</p><ul><li>Stage I: 2021/02/10 10:00 – 2021/03/07 03:59</li><li>Stage II: 2021/02/14 04:00 – 2021/03/07 03:59</li><li>Stage III: 2021/02/18 04:00 – 2021/03/07 03:59</li></ul><h2>How to Craft Xiao Lantern in Genshin Impact?</h2><p>To craft the Genshin Impact Xiao Lantern, you first have to complete the quest called “The Origin of Lanterns.” Once you do, visit Jingming in Liyue Harbor to learn how to craft the lanterns. You are going to need three ingredients – Lantern Fiber, Wick Material, and Plaustrite Shard. The first ingredient comes from certain harvestable plants, the second from hilichurl-type enemies and Fatui elites, and the third one from harvestable ores, Geovishap Hatchlings, Geovishaps, and Stonehide Lawachurls. When you obtain all the ingredients, go to the nearest Crafting Bench. That’s where you can make your own Xiao Lanterns. They are necessary for completing “Lantern Rite Tales” requests and “Theater Mechanicus” challenges.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvSrqWop5JjsLC5jqCcp6uYnrtutcypmJysX6Gur8DEq6VmqpmpsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

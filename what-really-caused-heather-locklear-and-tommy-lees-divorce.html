When appearing on "20/20" in October of that year, the rock star was asked if he had stayed faithful while married to Heather Locklear. "Absolutely. When I'm in love ... I don't even look," he replied, per <a href=#>ABC News</a>. Shortly after, Lee contradicted himself and revealed that his infidelities were what led to their divorce.</p><p dir=ltr>During an interview for <a href=#>Blender</a>'s December 2004 issue, the Mötley Crüe member discussed his various trysts with adult film stars. "Yeah, f***ing with porno stars ruined my marriage," Lee told Blender (via <a href=#>Blabbermouth.net</a>). "That was in '93, right before I got divorced from Heather [Locklear]," he added. The "Girls, Girls, Girls" artist was also asked how many women he had slept with in total, and Lee struggled to come up with a number. "F***. I don't know. Two...hundred?" he replied.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>A year earlier, Locklear weighed in on her love life. Although the "Melrose Place" star did not mention her ex-husband by name, she took a magnanimous approach while discussing her past. "You just have to forgive them for being men," she told <a href=#>Esquire</a> in 2003. "You can't keep changing men, so you settle for changing your lipstick," Locklear told the publication in a piece filled with notable quotes. "I don't date rock 'n' rollers. I just marry them," the former soap opera star added. Years later, a famous radio personality said they believed those rock star relationships led to Locklear's undoing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhjaYVxgI6wn5qsXaeyorjLsmScmaWosqV5x56YraCVp3qtu8Kko56ZomKur7CMraampaliuaax0maboq6fp7Cmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

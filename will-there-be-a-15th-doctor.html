On May 8, 2022, the BBC revealed that Ncuti Gatwa will play the Doctor in the 14th season of Doctor Who in 2023. This makes him the 14th actor to play the role as a regular on the series and the 16th Doctor overall. (John Hurt and Jo Martin have played other “secret” versions of the Doctor.)<h2>Who is going to be the 15th Doctor?</h2>Ncuti Gatwa will take over from Jodie Whittaker as the Time Lord in Doctor Who, the BBC has announced.

We all fell in love with her in Heartstopper, one of those shows which changes the world—and now Yasmin can change the Whoniverse!”</p><h2>Why David Tennant As The 14th Doctor Could Actually Work</h2><p></p><h2>Is Julia Foster going to be the 14th Doctor?</h2>Julia Foster is the 14th Doctor, with Tennant Back as Companion. Veteran actress Julia Foster will replace Jodie Whittaker after she bows out from Doctor Who in this year's festive special. Despite claims to the contrary, Whittaker in fact filmed her final scenes late last year.<h2>Will David Tennant come back to Doctor Who?</h2>(CNN) David Tennant and Catherine Tate are returning to "Doctor Who," the BBC has confirmed. The 10th Doctor and his companion, Donna Noble, are filming scenes that are due to air in 2023 to coincide with the show's 60th anniversary celebrations, the broadcaster said in a statement Sunday.<h2>Will Doctor Who ever end?</h2>The 2021 season of Doctor Who will be shorter than usual as it will be Jodie Whittaker's third and final outing as the Time Lord, as she is set to exit the sci-fi series in 2022, following a trio of specials.<h2>How many regenerations does the Doctor have left?</h2>But as every "Whovian" knows, the Doctor cannot last for ever: Time Lords are able to regenerate only 12 times before they die.<h2>Is the thirteenth Doctor the last?</h2>Peter Capaldi confirmed a year later that the tenth series would be his last, too.<h2>Who is the 14th Doctor 2022?</h2>The BBC has announced that Ncuti Gatwa, who plays Eric Effiong on Sex Education, will be playing the 14th Doctor!<h2>Who is the oldest actor to play the Doctor?</h2>Capaldi is tied with the First Doctor, William Hartnell, as the oldest actor to be cast in the role. Both were aged 55 when cast.<h2>Who is the next Doctor 2022?</h2>The new Doctor Who 2022 is Ncuti Gatwa - full name Mizero Ncuti Gatwa - and star of Sex Education.

Tom Holland would be a great Doctor Who! Others are relieved that Tom isn't the new Doctor.</p><h2>How long can a Time Lord live?</h2>Well, the way I see it, at least from the point of view as it's presented, is each timelord life gets around about 80-100 years, so they age normally, if a timelord regenerates due to injury (as every doctor bar Hartnell) has, the "extra years" stack up into the next regeneration, so they could potentially live twice ...<h2>Does the Doctor have infinite regenerations?</h2>Doctor Who Just Removed One Of The Original Show's Most Frustrating Time Lord Rules. Doctor Who just undid one of its major rules regarding the Time Lord regeneration process, allowing The Doctor to have unlimited regenerations. Warning: The following contains SPOILERS for Doctor Who "The Timeless Children."<h2>Do all Gallifreyans regenerate?</h2>As much as it annoys me to say it, the evidence points towards Gallifreyans not being able to regenerate, at least without Symbiotic Nuclei. One case of such is when we see Gallifreyan citizens being slaughtered by Daleks. On the other hand, Daleks have some pretty goddamn good weapons.<h2>Who is the next Dr Who 2021?</h2>The new Doctor has finally been revealed. Following Jodie Whittaker's upcoming departure from the TARDIS, we now know the identity of the new lead in Doctor Who. Ncuti Gatwa will play the 14th Doctor in the upcoming series from the mind of Russell T Davies.<h2>What is the Doctor's true name?</h2>John Smith. The Doctor's most common alias (apart from the Doctor, obviously), this is his standard pseudonym on Earth.<h2>Why did David Tennant leave Dr Who?</h2>A lifelong fan<p>The Doctor, however, must regenerate eventually, and Tennant decided that time should come on his own terms. Like so many of his fellow Britons, he has been a Doctor Who fan his entire life, and being able to be The Doctor was a supreme childhood dream fulfilled.</p><h2>Will Jodie Whittaker be in season 14?</h2>Doctor Who season 14 potential release date: When will it air? Following the 2021 New Years special and Easter's pirate escapade, there will only be one more outing for Jodie Whittaker and Chris Chibnall later in autumn this year before season 14 arrives.

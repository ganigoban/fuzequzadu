Well, <a href=#>through our trusted and proven sources</a>, we can report that Jenna Ortega is in talks to portray the White Tiger in Daredevil: Born Again. Ortega will first debut as the character in the new Daredevil series before heading off into the MCU for her own solo project.</p><p>Jenna Ortega being cast as White Tiger is fantastic news, considering it means that the new Daredevil: Born Again series is going to be introducing some new characters from Matt Murdock’s life that the world has not seen yet. The partnership between White Tiger and Daredevil is quite exciting as well, which could lead to many more partnerships happening, as the White Tiger is often a close ally with Daredevil, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, and <a href=#>Spider-Man</a>. This character also gives Matt Murdock the responsibility of being a teacher as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Wednesday-900x504.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/white-tiger-900x506.jpg><p>Jenna Ortega coming into the role of the White Tiger brings her into one of the more fabled superhero stories, as the White Tiger is born from the Jade Tiger, a mystical statue that is in the kingdom of K’un-L’un. This statue is destroyed, and the paws and head are worn by martial artists in America known as the Sons of the Tiger, which gives them all martial arts powers when the amulets are worn. The Sons are disbanded, leaving Hector Ayala to discover the amulets, becoming the first White Tiger.</p><p>Matt Murdock represents Hector Ayala in a trial where he is accused of murder, and when he attempts to escape, he is shot dead. Hector is found to be innocent, but in his death, he passes the amulet to his niece, Angela del Toro. Angela is likely who Jenna Ortega is set to portray when she becomes the White Tiger for Daredevil: Born Again. Matt Murdock then takes Angela under his wing and trains her in the skills of martial arts.</p><p>While everyone is hoping that<a href=#> Jon Bernthal’s Punisher </a>is going to be the main partner for Daredevil, it is great that Jenna Ortega is being brought in as White Tiger, as Murdock now has a younger student to pass on the teachings of fighting that he has learned. White Tiger and Daredevil form a special bond with one another, which comes to an ultimate test when she is killed by Lady Bullseye. A fun fact about that is White Tiger is resurrected and becomes the next Elektra, though we are not sure if Marvel is going to take the character in that direction in her eventual solo series.</p><p>Daredevil has been one of everyone’s favorite heroes and <a href=#>MCU </a>characters, and it is great that more of his partners are <a href=#>being added</a>, which could mean that more of his antagonists might be showing up too. We have yet to see Bullseye, who is arguably his greatest villain apart from Kingpin. Disney and Marvel are clearly wanting to bring in lesser-shown characters from Daredevil’s history and adding Jenna Ortega as White Tiger is certainly a step in the right direction.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2idqJi5tr%2FIr5xmopWju6J5zqurnp%2BRYsSptdOeZK2hl5q%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

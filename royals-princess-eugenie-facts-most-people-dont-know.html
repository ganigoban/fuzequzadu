She excelled at schoolwork, obtaining impressive A-level results in 2008. Though the royals aren't exactly known for their academic prowess, Eugenie has proven herself the exception, with her grades far surpassing those of any of her regal relatives, according to the&nbsp;<a href=#>Independent</a>. Her parents were so pleased with her performance that they released a statement, declaring, "She has worked extremely hard towards these justifiably fantastic results."</p><p dir=ltr>But before heading to college, the bright teen decided to pull a "Booksmart" and live the high life. Accordingly, Eugenie went on a gap year in which she traveled to America, India, South Africa, and Thailand, per <a href=#>Express</a>. As noted by the&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, her travels proved highly controversial, as the British taxpayers were funding her security, which amounted to a whopping £250,000 (around $282,000). Moreover, it was during this period that Eugenie developed a party gal reputation. Per the Daily Mail, her activities abroad reportedly included "topless bathing, incessant drinking, visits to nightclubs and unseemly behavior" (she had previously been&nbsp;<a href=#>caught cavorting in the nude</a> following her high school graduation).</p><p dir=ltr>Following her trip around the world, Eugenie attended Newcastle University, where she studied English Literature and History of Art. A professor at the institution,&nbsp;Dr. Martin Farr, later claimed that the princess was only accepted into the college because of her privileged status, though the vice chancellor <a href=#>refuted the claims</a>. After graduating in 2012, Eugenie expressed her excitement at starting her first job, per <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhlZ4Nyg46rprKZnKh6sb7Ip5qeq6NisrazxKegnmWWlrC1v4ympqysXaWysLzLnmSdp56peqy6zrBm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

In 2016, the actor was interviewed at the SXSW Music, Film + Interactive Festival amid speculation that Washington and her husband,&nbsp;Nnamdi Asomugha, were facing marital strife. The performer explained her choice to keep quiet about the relationship on social media. "I think—and this is something Reese Witherspoon has talked about a lot—it's a little different for me because I don't talk about my personal life," Washington said, per <a href=#>Just Jared</a>.</p><p>She went on to address the benefits of using social media to speak the truth for public figures. "Social media has actually been great for [other celebrities'] relationships with the weeklies or the gossip sites because people say things, and they say, 'That's not true! Just so you know, that's BS!'" Washington said before adding, "So I'm thinking in some ways, it's been great because people are able to maintain their voice."&nbsp;</p><p>Washington also mentioned her plans to keep her marriage private in a 2013 interview with <a href=#>Glamour</a>, which occurred in the months after her and Asomugha's wedding. "I'm walking around in the world with my ring. And when people say congratulations, I say thank you," Washington said. "But I'm going to continue to not talk about it and just let it unfold."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamthaoN1hI6wn7Jlm5q%2Fs8WMsJisoJmjtLW7zWalnq6Vp3qxu9KtqmagpaivorrDZqqom5mWuW65xJ2gmmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

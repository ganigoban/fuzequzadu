At this star-studded event, David, then a key figure at Real Madrid and aged 48, was reportedly engaged in a discreet conversation with a Spanish model, secluded at the garden's end. “That hurt,” Rebecca expressed, the pain still palpable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5ce2a12722ef-rebecca-loos.jpg><p id=eUbgyKXGUE2 data-wc=22>The twist in the tale was set into motion by a single phone call. Victoria Beckham, David's wife, reached out to Rebecca.&nbsp;</p><p id=eg3kvrDM7ow data-wc=37>Her distress was evident: David wasn’t answering her calls. "She's upset because she's calling David and he's not answering," Rebecca detailed.

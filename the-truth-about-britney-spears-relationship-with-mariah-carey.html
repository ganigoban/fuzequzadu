In a 1999&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a> from when she was a teen, Spears wasn't shy about admitting how much of an impact the "Hero" hitmaker had on her own career. "I've always been really influenced by Mariah Carey," she said, adding, "I love her melodies, she's a great songwriter." Spears is such a fan of Carey, in fact, that she told <a href=#>The Dan & Maz Show</a>&nbsp;in 2015 that she enjoys painting without clothes on to MC's greatest hits at home. After finding out, Carey responded, <a href=#>tweeting</a>,"hahaha! @britneyspears's the best!"</p><p dir=ltr>It's been well-documented over the years that Carey isn't aware of all her fellow female singers after her iconic <a href=#>"I don't know her"</a> meme.&nbsp;For this reason, she played a game of "Does! She! Know! Her!?" on&nbsp;<a href=#>"Watch What Happens Live"</a>&nbsp;in 2016. When asked if she knows Miss Spears, Carey immediately declared her admiration, expressing, "I love Britney Spears!"</p><p>In September 2017, Spears took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to share a snapshot of herself alongside Carey at a dinner party. "You never know who you're going to meet at dinner parties!! Great night! So much fun," she captioned the post. The duo looked happy to be in each other's company, flashing a smile directly at the camera. When asked about the event on Cohen's <a href=#>"WWHL"</a>&nbsp;in 2018,&nbsp;Carey stated that Spears had always been a "sweetheart" from the first moment they met.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcXFnbH16e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2Xv6rAzZ6wZqugmq6zv4yrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmr5mptW65wKugmqBdmK6zsdho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

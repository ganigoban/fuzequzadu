Yes, Miley Cyrus' older brother. The "Suite Life of Zack and Cody" star first started dating the musician back in 2010, and the pair actually got engaged in October 2011. Trace broke the happy news in a since-deleted tweet saved by <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>,&nbsp;in which he enthused, "I am very excited to say, last week I asked my girlfriend Brenda Song to marry me and she said YES!" Miley was all for it, responding, "Can't wait for Brenda to be a Cyrus." Unfortunately, that never happened. In June 2012, the couple ended their engagement with Trace telling <a href=#>People</a> they had called it quits months earlier and sharing, "We will continue to focus on our careers."</p><p dir=ltr>Even so, it wasn't totally over. In 2013, <a href=#>E! News</a>&nbsp;spotted the exes spending time together in California just as Song cryptically tweeted, "Don't give up on someone you can't go a full day without thinking about." Jump to May 2015, and they split again as Trace publicly accused Song of pretending to be pregnant. In an Instagram post saved by <a href=#>J-14</a>, the actor wrote, "I apologize for not clearing this up sooner and for the continual damage that these lies have caused @TraceCyrus." Trace clapped back, "Yes they were lies THAT U MADE UP and told me, my entire family and all our friends." By June, though, they appeared to have reconciled again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampja4Jzg46bqZ6mlJZ6tLvNoGSappRiwbOtwp5knLGiqsBuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZpuinJ6peq2t0q1koZ1drL%2BwwMRmmGarn6O0bq3BqKytZZmpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

By Douglas Helm | Published 2 years ago The Gentlemen is one of the more underrated Guy Ritchie films, despite the star-studded cast. Fortunately for fans of the film, it looks like it’s getting a second chance as a TV series on Netflix. Miramax TV and Moonage Pictures will be producing the series alongside Ritchie as executive producer.
Guy Ritchie will have a fairly heavy presence in the production of the show, as he co-wrote the pilot with Matthew Read."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Fortunately for fans of the film, it looks like it’s getting a second chance as a TV series on Netflix. Miramax TV and Moonage Pictures will be producing the series alongside Ritchie as executive producer.</p><p>Guy Ritchie will have a fairly heavy presence in the production of the show, as he co-wrote the pilot with Matthew Read. He’ll also be directing the first two episodes, giving it his signature directorial touch and presumably informing the visual style of the rest of the series. Funnily enough, The Gentlemen was initially pitched as a TV series before it became a movie, so this is a fitting place for the IP to go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/guy-ritchie-the-gentlemen.jpg><p>If you missed The Gentlemen movie in 2019, it was a kinetic feature from director Guy Ritchie with a star-studded cast. The movie told the story of Mickey Pearson (<a href=#>Matthew McConaughey</a>), an American who established a thriving marijuana empire in London. When Pearson decides he wants to cash out and get out of the business, people come out of the woodwork to try and take his marijuana kingdom from him. The cast is rounded out by Charlie Hunnam, Michelle Dockery, Jeremy Strong, Colin Farrell, Lyne, Renee, Henry Golding, and Hugh Grant. The movie was <a href=#>well-liked</a> by those who did see it, and it actually did fairly well at the <a href=#>box office</a>, grossing $115 million worldwide against a budget of $22 million.</p><p>The Gentlemen is actually Guy Ritchie’s fifth-highest-grossing movie behind King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword, his two Sherlock films, and the live-action Aladdin movie. This isn’t too bad considering all of those other movies were based on existing characters and properties that audiences were already familiar with. As for the direction of this new show, there’s no news on the plot and the casting. The movie certainly left things open for a continued story, but we’ll just have to wait and see where Ritchie wants to take the story. Plus, who knows if any of these stars will want to tie themselves to multiple episodes of a TV series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/guy-ritchie-the-gentlemen2.jpg><p>Though the new TV series based on The Gentlemen isn’t Guy Ritchie’s first attempt at the TV, it is one of his only attempts. He executive produced and wrote material for Lock, Stock… and directed and produced a TV film called Suspect. The Gentlemen will mark the third time that a Ritchie film was turned into a TV series, as Lock, Stock… was based on Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. A TV series based on Snatch was also created, but Ritchie wasn’t involved.</p><p>While there isn’t much information about The Gentlemen show at this time, it’s sure to have plenty of gangster action, signature Guy Ritchie panache, and all the hallmarks of his directorial style. In the meantime, you can check out his latest film titled <a href=#>Operation Fortune: Ruse de guerre</a>, which stars <a href=#>Jason Statham</a>, Aubrey Plaza, Cary Elwes, Josh Hartnett, Hugh Grant, and many more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ifpa56s7XTnJ%2BinV2jsrWyy6KvZqyYmnqosc2to56llaN7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

If you use salted butter, reduce the salt by ¼ teaspoon.</li><li><strong>Brown Sugar</strong>&nbsp;— this is what gives the cookies that perfectly chewy center.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong>&nbsp;— this is what gives the cookie sweetness and crisp edges.</li><li><strong>Eggs</strong>&nbsp;— this is the binder that pulls the liquid and dry ingredients together.</li><li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong>&nbsp;— use pure vanilla extract in cookies for authentic flavor.</li><li><strong>Red Food Coloring</strong> — may use liquid or gel food coloring.</li><li><strong>Unsweetened Cocoa Powder</strong> — this gives the cookies a hint of light chocolate flavor. I buy Callebaut cocoa powder in the bulk bins at Winco.</li><li><strong>Flour</strong>&nbsp;— use all-purpose flour in these cookies.</li><li><strong>Cornstarch</strong> — this is what gives the red velvet cookies the extra soft texture.</li><li><strong>Baking Soda</strong>&nbsp;— this gives the cookies the perfect rise.</li><li><strong>Salt</strong>&nbsp;— a flavor enhancer and a must in all baking recipes.</li></ul><p><strong>Cream Cheese Frosting Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Butter </strong>— use salted butter to make this cream cheese frosting.</li><li><strong>Cream Cheese </strong>— use full-fat cream cheese and make sure to soften the cream cheese before whipping it.</li><li><strong>Powdered Sugar — </strong>also known as confectioner’s sugar.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Red-Velvet-Cookies-with-Cream-Cheese-Frosting-1-720x956.jpg alt="Soft, chewy homemade red velvet cookies topped with a sweet cream cheese frosting.

This helps to create a smooth textured cookie and also gives loft to the cookie dough which helps the cookies to rise once they hit the oven.</li><li><strong>Add eggs, pure vanilla extract, and red food coloring and mix for 1 minute longer. </strong>Add food coloring to desired red color.</li><li><strong>Fold in cocoa powder, flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt</strong>. Be careful not to overmix once you add the dry ingredients as it can create too much gluten in the dough and will result in a tougher cookie.</li><li><strong>Scoop onto parchment paper lined, light-colored baking sheet</strong>.</li><li><strong>Bake just until the centers start to puff up</strong>. You don’t want to overbake as the cookies will continue to bake on the cookie sheet once it is removed from the oven. It is better to underbake than overbake!</li><li><strong>Let red velvet cookies cool</strong>. Once the cookies have cooled, you can frost them with homemade cream cheese frosting.</li><li><strong>To make the cream cheese frosting</strong>, whip softened butter and cream cheese for 1 minute. Add powdered sugar and whip for 1-2 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of milk if you need a thinner frosting. May add vanilla extract for extra flavor.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Red-Velvet-Cookies-with-Cream-Cheese-Frosting-3-720x869.jpg alt="Soft, chewy homemade red velvet cookies topped with a sweet cream cheese frosting.

You need less gel food coloring in recipes and it is a thicker consistency so it is perfect when you don’t want extra liquid in a recipe.</p><p>Liquid food coloring has a water base and a thinner consistency. You will generally need more liquid food coloring in a recipe because it is thinner and not as concentrated as gel food coloring.</p><h3>How do I know when the Red Velvet Cookies are done baking?</h3><p>These soft red velvet cookies are perfectly chewy and it is important to not overbake these cookies.</p><p>The cookies will begin to spread and the edges will start to crinkle slightly and the centers puff up. It is better to pull them out on the earlier side as the cookies will continue to bake on the cookie sheet once you remove them from the oven.</p><h3>What type of cocoa powder do I use in these cookies?</h3><p>I suggest using a good-quality unsweetened cocoa powder.&nbsp;</p><p>I buy Callebaut cocoa powder at Winco in their bulk bin section. It is so reasonably priced compared to what you would pay online and the quality is amazing.</p><p>I also suggest Ghirardelli, Trader Joe’s, and Guittard.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Red-Velvet-Cookies-with-Cream-Cheese-Frosting-2-crop-720x759.jpg alt="Soft, chewy homemade red velvet cookies topped with a sweet cream cheese frosting.

Let's just say he couldn't be any cuter if he tried.

I was a tomboy, and I always play best with boys. When we found out, I was so excited.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added: “I was looking at him the other day, and I was like, ‘I understand now why people keep having babies!’ We’ll probably have two. I think it’s best not to be outnumbered.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Conrad and Tell might not be outnumbered now, but that doesn't mean Liam is making things difficult. According to Conrad, he's a model baby so far.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I feel so spoiled,” she says. “Liam is such a good baby. I’m sleeping three to four hours at a time. This morning I was up at 4 a.m. and I wasn’t even tired, so I cleaned the kitchen and did some cooking. William was like, ‘You’re crazy!’"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Right now, the new family of three is looking forward to a happy future together, and Conrad already knows the lessons she'd like Liam to learn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I want to be strong and teach him to respect women. The mother-son relationship is so important,” she said. “And I’m just excited to play again! I can’t wait to break out the finger paints. And I’m such a Disney nerd, so I get to watch those movies with someone who is seeing them for the first time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We wish them lots of happy playtime going forward.

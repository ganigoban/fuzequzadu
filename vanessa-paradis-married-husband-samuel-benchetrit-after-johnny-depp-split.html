Paradis and Benchetrit got together in October 2016, when she starred in his 2018 film "Chien." The couple quietly became engaged in November 2017, according to a source who spoke with <a href=#>People</a>. Other reports claimed the engagement happened in March 2018, though neither confirmed the rumors.</p><p>Unlike his wife, Benchetrit had been married before. In 1998, Benchetrit wed French actor&nbsp;Marie Trintignant, but their marriage ended in tragedy. After starting an affair with the lead singer of the French rock band Noir Désir,&nbsp;Bertrand Cantat, Trintignant abruptly left Benchetrit,&nbsp;<a href=#>The New York Times</a> reported. But&nbsp;the couple&nbsp;continued to have an amicable relationship, which Cantat disapproved of. A message sent by Benchetrit to his estranged wife while she and Cantat were in a Lithuanian hotel room pushed Cantat over the edge.</p><p>Cantat beat up Trintignant, who died five days later from brain injuries. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and released on parole in 2007, <a href=#>The Guardian</a> reported. Benchetrit and Trintignant share a son, Jules, who was just 5 when his mother died. In 2017, Paradis paid tribute to her then-boyfriend's ex-wife on <a href=#>Instagram</a> as a way to protest&nbsp;Les Inrocks magazine's decision to feature Cantat on its cover. "We miss Marie," she and her sister Alysson captioned the <a href=#>Instagram</a> post, adding the hashtag "Les Inrocks of shame."</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233.

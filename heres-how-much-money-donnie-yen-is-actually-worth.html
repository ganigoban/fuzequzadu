However, that's simply because the world hasn't been paying attention. The martial arts expert's <a href=#>IMDb</a> page is a showcase of a career spent well, from his lead role in the&nbsp;Ip Man&nbsp;franchise to a number of high-profile Hollywood roles, from his stint as Chirrut Imwe in&nbsp;Rogue One:&nbsp;A Star Wars Story&nbsp;to his announced role as the Emperor in Disney's live-action version of&nbsp;Mulan. What's more, he's a particularly brave Kung Fu actor because he's not afraid to leave his significant body of martial arts work behind him:&nbsp;In 2019, the 56-year-old Yen told&nbsp;<a href=#>South China Morning Post</a>&nbsp;that Ip Man 4&nbsp;will be his last Kung Fu film:&nbsp;"As an actor, you must keep going forward," Yen says. "This is something that I must do in life; I must keep exploring to grow."&nbsp;</p><p>It's a pretty bold move for a man predominantly known for his&nbsp;<a href=#>martial arts</a> movies, though it's easy to assume Yen realizes he may be getting a bit old for all those fancy moves. It almost makes you think that he must have a decent enough nest egg on his bank account so he doesn't have to worry about going broke even if his future cinematic aspirations won't go as planned. The question is, then:&nbsp;Just how much money is Donnie Yen worth?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Donnie Yen is worth $40 million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.grunge.com/img/gallery/heres-how-much-money-donnie-yen-is-actually-worth/donnie-yen-is-worth-40-million-1577220321.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Myunggu Han/Getty Images</span><p>According to wealth estimating sites such as&nbsp;<a href=#>The Richest</a> and <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Donnie Yen is worth a very decent $40 million. The bulk of this comes from his cinematic endeavors like acting — though it must be mentioned he is also a producer, choreographer and director. His net worth may be relatively low when compared to stars like <a href=#>Jackie Chan</a>&nbsp;or <a href=#>Jet Li</a>, but it appears that unlike the two, Yen has been mostly content to keep away from extracurricular business enterprises, seemingly devoting his entire focus to kick as much rear as humanly possible on the silver screen.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9l2lvcGlfnbKzsdJmn6ivXaLCpLSMpqannalisbC6zaKcZrGVo3qqv4yamq2tkaG5unnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

This live rendition of the song takes the listener on a journey through the emotional rollercoaster experienced by a woman in search of her place in a world that constantly dictates what costume she should wear.At its core, the overarching theme of the song revolves around the pressure to conform and the tension between personal identity and societal norms. The "poor girl" mentioned in the lyrics represents an individual who is forced to wear a figurative costume to all tomorrow's parties, signifying the need to pretend and adapt to fit in with societal expectations. This theme resonates strongly with many people as it examines the challenges of self-expression and the sacrifices individuals make to be accepted.One standout lyric in the song states, "And where will she go and what shall she do when midnight comes around?" This lyric delves into the internal struggle faced by the girl as she navigates her way through life. It raises the question of where one finds solace when they have to shed their true identity. As midnight symbolizes a time of darkness and solitude, the poor girl's search for her authentic self becomes even more challenging.Another noteworthy line is, "And what will she do with Thursday's rags when Monday comes around?"

The girl must discard her previous "costume" and adapt to a new one, highlighting the exhausting nature of trying to meet societal standards.The line, "For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown, for whom none will go mourning," introduces the theme of loneliness and the feeling of being overlooked. The poor girl becomes the entertainer, always wearing a facade, but no one mourns her true self. This lyric underscores the sacrifice she makes to preserve her place in the social order and highlights the emotional toll it takes on her.The final lyric, "She sits and cries... for all tomorrow's parties," illustrates the emotional turmoil experienced by the poor girl. Despite putting on a brave face and conforming to society's expectations, she finds herself crying behind closed doors.

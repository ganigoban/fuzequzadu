And Major "Proud" Of Seven-Year-Old Heiress</h2></span><p>It's no secret that T.I. takes great pride in his family, as does his wife, Tiny. In November, he cleared a few things up about his family dynamic following some recent drama. 19-year-old King Harris got into a spat with his parents at an Atlanta Falcons game last month, which was livestreamed to his fans on Instagram. The incident brought about some speculation about the up-and-coming rapper's relationship with his parents, but T.I. made it clear that <a href=# rel>all is well with his family</a>.</p><p>"Fck what dis internet talkin bout... Da Harris Family Tied Like a Knot. We all We Got...4LIFE," he wrote. "Ima RIDE to da heavens or da depths of HELL bout my Jr. & ain’t nothing gon change that." Tiny has also <a href=# rel>shown love to King online</a> since the altercation, claiming that he's "always been [her] sweetheart" earlier this month. "My two sons telling their story in their music. #FatherLikeSons @domani support our Kings!!!" she added.

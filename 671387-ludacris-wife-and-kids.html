From their business moves to overcoming infidelities, their relationship has been an interesting one to follow. Ludacris, who holds the titles of a rapper, actor, and entrepreneur, and Eudoxie Bridges, a businesswoman and philanthropist, have been together for over a decade. Like many couples, they faced obstacles that <a href=# rel>could have broken them apart. </a>However, the couple chose to work through their issues and rebuild their trust.</p><p>Their decision to stay together and make their relationship work shows a level of maturity and dedication rare in celebrity relationships. Throughout their journey together, they have shared their thoughts and feelings about their romance, offering insights into what makes their relationship work. We'll look at Ludacris and Eudoxie's love story, from their first meeting to where they stand today.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How They Met</h2></span><p>Eudoxie and Ludacris attend The 4th Annual Thanksgiving Carnival & Turkey Giveaway on November 23, 2010 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Photo by Prince Williams/FilmMagic)</p><p>Ludacris and Eudoxie first met in 2008 when the rapper hosted an event for his annual <a href=# rel>LudaDay Weekend</a> in Atlanta. Eudoxie migrated from West Africa to America to create a better life for herself. Then, the chance meeting with Luda changed everything. The pair began dating, and while they didn't share details of their romance with the world, their bond strengthened.</p><p>Eudoxie also made a surprising revelation in 2018 while celebrating their anniversary. “Today marks 10 years we’ve known each other,” she captioned a social media post. The image showed the couple sharing an adorable kiss. “We met August 30th Ludaday weekend 2008 but don’t get it twisted he didn’t get to kiss these lips until 2009.”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Relationship Troubles</h2></span><p>ATLANTA, GA - SEPTEMBER 01: Ludacris and Eudoxie Bridges attend Jeezy TM-104 Album Release Party at Compound on September 1, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia.(Photo by Prince Williams/Wireimage)</p><p>In 2013, it was revealed that Ludacris had fathered a child with Tamika Fuller, a longtime friend, while he was on a break from his relationship with Eudoxie. The news shocked Eudoxie, who had been with Ludacris for several years at that point. The revelation caused a lot of controversy and negative attention towards the rapper. However, the couple decided to work through their issues and reconciled. Ludacris and Fuller would later engage in <a href=# rel>a contentious legal war </a>over their daughter.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Their Beautiful Family</h2></span><p>Despite the setback, Ludacris and Eudoxie's relationship continued to flourish. In 2014, the couple got engaged on a private plane, and later that same day, they tied the knot in a small ceremony. The happy couple shared the big surprise with their millions of fans on social media.</p><p>The couple welcomed their first child, a daughter named Cadence Gaelle Bridges, in 2015. <a href=# rel>Their second arrived in 2021</a>. Ludacris also has three other children from previous relationships, Karma, Cai, and Shaila. That makes the rap icon a father of five girls—the ultimate hip hop "girl dad."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ludacris-eudoxie-today>Ludacris & Eudoxie Today</h2></span><p>After weathering the pandemic with their blended brood, Luda and his wife welcomed their latest addition. In the Summer of 2021, Eudoxie gave birth to their second child. "That's the biggest difference," Ludacris told Distractify of trying to hold down a bustling household. "We've made sure that we’ve kept them busy, as opposed to wandering around the house. In a nutshell, it's just us being more hands-on with teaching them things that may not be a part of their everyday curriculum in virtual school.” The couple also launched businesses with his children in mind, moving from rap star to acclaimed actor to business mogul.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>][<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>][<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbH50hJZmo66ckZi%2Fqr%2BMsKCfnV2Wu6V5yqKbrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

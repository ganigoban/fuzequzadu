Indefinitely delayed, Willa, a magical thinker, and Bill, a catastrophic one, find themselves just as attracted to and annoyed by one another as they did decades earlier. But as they unpack the riddle of their mutual past and compare their lives to the dreams they once shared, they begin to wonder if their reunion is mere coincidence, or something more enchanted."</p><p id=eQL450Bcos data-wc=80>Set to land in cinemas on October 13, Meg has already teased what's to come. Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>, she said: "It has a relationship to movies from the '40s, like Bringing Up Baby, in terms of the banter and the rhythm of things and a lot of that era of filmmaking. Nora Ephron used to say about rom-coms that they were really a secretly incredible delivery system to comment on the times, and we do that in this movie."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eE-PHH9n4z data-wc=58>Praising her co-star David Duchovny, Meg added: "It's just been really fun to see David embrace this guy who I don't think is anything really like David. Whereas the Willa thing I can really relate to. To see him dive into every single scene in the fullest way, he's funny, and he's smart, and he's dear, and irresistible."</p><p id=eotgnK071SxY data-wc=30>Back in November last year, Meg first confirmed that What Happens Later was in development. Revealing the film's poster on her social media, the tagline read: "They missed their connection."</p><p id=e9uaqU_hlBzM data-wc=28>What Happens Later is the second film that Meg has directed, following 2015's Ithaca, her last feature film project, excluding an archival footage cameo in Top Gun: Maverick.</p><p id=eqTQul5Ro-LP data-wc=43>The actress made her film debut in 1981 in Rich and Famous while appearing on TV in As The World Turns as a main cast member for two years.

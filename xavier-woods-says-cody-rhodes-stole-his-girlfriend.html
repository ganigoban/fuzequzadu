It turns out that Cody Rhodes and Xavier Woods knew each other decades before they even stepped foot in WWE. That also resulted in quite a story.</p><p>Cody Rhodes is currently one of the top stars in the wrestling industry, and has found happiness in his marriage to Brandi Rhodes and their shared journey as parents to a daughter. However, there was a time when Rhodes was not as devoted to committed relationships.</p><p>During an appearance on <a href=#>Inside The Ropes,</a> Rhodes shared an anecdote about his prior acquaintance with Xavier Woods before their WWE days, recalling a situation where he was involved with Woods’ girlfriend at the time.</p><p>“Xavier Woods and I went to high school together. We end up wrestling, one time he wrestles up a weight class to wrestle me. If you ask Xavier Woods he’s going to tell you a completely different version of the story. The legitimate version is he loses by just a few points. Fast forward to I’m on their side of the town at a bowling alley, with a girl I just started seeing named Lindsey.”</p><p>“I guess Lindsey and Xavier used to see one another, so Xavier Woods shows up….And I see him and I don’t know if I got lucky or not but I grab the ball and roll it down the lane and its a f**king strike. And I walk over to him and I said, I know you, I beat you and I walk away and didn’t think anything of it.”</p><p>You never know where life will take you, and that goes double when love and pro wrestling are involved. Thankfully, Xavier Woods doesn’t seem too shaken up about how everything went down. Then again, he had a few years to let things settle.</p><p>Cody Rhodes was quite a ladies man back in the day, what would you do if he stole your girl?

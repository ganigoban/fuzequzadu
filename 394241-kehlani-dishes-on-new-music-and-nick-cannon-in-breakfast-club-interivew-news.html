I really like writing about love. Love is how I think I learned about myself most in this life," the&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"I Like Dat"</a> singer explained. "Now I'm 26. And I'm dropping songs that are just about ... I don't need anybody. And I think I was coming from such a place of like, need in the past. You can hear it. You can hear it in the lyrics."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Talking about why performing those old songs can be tough because it's like hopping back in time and space that no longer exists, Kehlani explained that Nick Cannon helped her transform into the artist she is today. The two met when Kehlani was on the Cannon-hosted America's Got Talent&nbsp;and years after her appearance on the show, Cannon reached out with multiple opportunities and helped propel her career.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"He changed my life forever. That's family to me," Kehlani said, noting that other artists have told her similar stories of Cannon's assistance. "So when there's all these conversations, and I've been waiting to say this somewhere, but while there's all these conversations that's picking him apart and like, people can call him corny and people can call him whatever ... he silently has changed the lives of so many people. He asked for nothing in return ... you would have no idea."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Finishing up her nearly-30 minute interview, Kehlani said her upcoming music is "so light." Explaining that this music won't be toxic or depressing, she asserted she is in a different place where "Everything is joyful and light and happy. There's really fun stuff and there's really pretty stuff. There's an orchestra on there ... it's in another world."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Blue Water Road&nbsp;is set to touch down within the next couple of months and, according to Kehlani, is going to sound different than what her fans are used to.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out Kehlani's full Breakfast Club interview below and let us know if you're excited for her new sound in the comments.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdjboFzgJBmop6gnJa7qnnDoqqhnaNivK95zZ6uZqWlqLakecCnm2ammZi4bq%2FAp6Wopl2eu26u0Z6YpJ6RqMFur8uumWahnqmys7XVnq5mppWswA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

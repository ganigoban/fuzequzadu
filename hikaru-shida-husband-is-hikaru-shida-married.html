In Japan, she showcases her wrestling skills in Oz Academy and Pro Wrestling Wave, where she holds the Wave Single Champion title in her second reign.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Shida</a> embarked on her professional wrestling journey in 2008 when she joined the Ice Ribbon promotion, a decision influenced by her involvement in the film “Three Count,” set in the world of professional wrestling. During her tenure with Ice Ribbon, which lasted until 2014, she achieved accolades such as the ICE×60 Champion and five-time International Ribbon Tag Team Champion.</p><p>Additionally, Hikaru Shida has clinched the Wave Single Championship twice, the Oz Academy Tag Team Championship, and the Sendai Girls Tag Team Championship. Her entry into AEW in April 2019 marked her as one of the inaugural female wrestlers in the promotion, where she went on to secure the AEW Women’s World Championship twice. Notably, she holds the record for the longest reign with the title, an impressive 372 days during her first reign. This reign remained unmatched in AEW until January 2023.</p><p>In her formative years, Shida immersed herself in judo and kendo, achieving a third-dan black belt in the latter. Her acting career included notable work on the television series “Muscle Venus,” where she formed an idol group alongside her co-stars. Her role in the film “Three Count,” set in the world of professional wrestling and featuring seasoned wrestlers like Emi Sakura, Kyoko Inoue, and Yoshiko Tamura, marked a pivotal moment.</p><p>Inspired by the role, Hikaru Shida began training under Emi Sakura at the Ice Ribbon dojo, leading her to pursue a career in professional wrestling. Her dedication led to her joining Ice Ribbon alongside fellow cast members Ichiko Mayu, Miyako Matsumoto, Sachiko Koga, Tomoyo Morihisa, Tsukasa Fujimoto, and Yuki Ueda. While most of the cast members didn’t persist, Shida, Matsumoto, and Fujimoto made successful transitions into the world of professional wrestling.</p><p>In 2022, Shida made her debut in Tokyo Joshi Pro-Wrestling (TJPW) after an absence of two and a half years from in-ring competition in Japan. Her return was marked by a victory against Hikari Noa at the Grand Princess ’22 event.</p><p>Subsequently, Hikaru Shida claimed the Wave Single Championship for the second time in her career by defeating Suzu Suzuki at Pro Wrestling WAVE’s 14th-anniversary show on August 14. Alongside Ibuki Hoshi, she also secured the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship by defeating Hamuko Hoshi and Makoto on September 24, marking her fifth reign with this title. While holding these titles, Shida achieved successful title defenses in AEW, including victories over The Bunny and Emi Sakura.</p><p>However, on March 19, 2023, Shida and Hoshi lost their International Ribbon Tag Team Championship to Hoshi and Makoto, concluding their 176-day reign.</p><p>Beyond her wrestling career, Shida has ventured into various forms of media. In 2008, she collaborated with the cast of “Muscle Venus” to record the song “Itsuka Kitto,” which later became the theme song for the “Three Count” film. Shida also appeared in the music video for angela’s song “The Lights of Heroes” in 2012. Additionally, she was part of the stage acting group Mizuiro Kakumei in 2014 and released her first gravure DVD, “Nure Shiri,” on August 29, 2014, followed by her second DVD, “Shiri Kamisama no Iutōri!,” on October 30, 2015.</p><p>Hikaru Shida made her debut as a playable character in the video game “AEW Fight Forever.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hikaru Shida Husband: Is Hikaru Shida Married?</h2><p>Details about her husband are not known, additionally, there are no details about her love life as it seems she has kept that aspect of her life away from the public.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqGgpJmiqnq0tMidmGagpaivorrDZqCsZZieuKK%2B1GaqoaGUlnqurdGroJ6cXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

At that time, news surfaced that he was the target of an extortion plot that centered around an alleged sex tape that was put together with footage from a weekend he spent in Las Vegas earlier this summer. He supposedly partied with&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a stripper</a> named Montia Sabbag, who lives in Long Beach, CA, but the woman's lawyer later set the record straight and said that Sabbag was&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">not behind</a> the reported extortion scheme.&nbsp;"I am not an extortionist... I had nothing to do with these recordings," she said, claiming that she is as much a victim as Hart&nbsp;is. Lisa Bloom, the woman's attorney, also came to her defense publicly.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“It is a crime to secretly put cameras in a private place like a hotel room,” Bloom said.&nbsp;“It is another crime to secretly record people in a private place. It is yet another crime to distribute those images. Montia is the victim of multiple felonies under state and federal laws.” She later tried to unite Hart and Sabbag on the investigation front. "We invite Mr. Hart to join us in bringing the perpetrator to justice,”&nbsp;she added. According to a new report from&nbsp;TMZ, Hart finally broke his silence on the matter during a recent comedy show in the show in the southern United States.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"We got a lot of s**t to talk about, people," said Hart in front of a big crowd that attended his stand-up performance in Atlanta on Saturday night (September 23rd). He went on to acknowledge that he's been "going through some s**t" but, despite his struggles, he appreciates his fans and supporters more than ever. He also said that the difficult experience was going to allow him to become a "better man" for his family and for those who look up to him as a role model as well. Hart is reportedly doing everything in his power to help investigators bring the individual responsible for the sex video to justice sooner rather than later. If something develops on that front, we'll be sure to keep you informed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoa4R0goyknK%2BhnmK1or7TZpidnKKawLSx0mapnpuVo8Fuv8KapZ2ZnGK2r3nSrZinnF2qvW6vzqacnbFdqLWww4ynnLCr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

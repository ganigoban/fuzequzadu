"Her family member came out, and I heard Drayton's voice from the top of the stairs saying she was coming out, and she came down the stairs and surrendered," Bowers said. He also explained that the case was extra important considering the age of the victim. "On a case like this where a juvenile is involved, it means a little more and you put a little effort into it to give the family some closure," Bowers said. He added: "It feels good. When we spoke last time I told you that the Marshals Service wouldn't rest until Tashawnda Drayton is in custody and we meant it."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Brazy isn't the only artist to find themselves in legal trouble this week.

See you there–and drink plenty of water because you will sweat…a lot. It’s gonna be a crazy summer.”</p><p>The hottest and heaviest tour of the year will feature a gaggle of rock’s heaviest bands: the Jagermeister stage will feature TRIVIUM, ALL THAT REMAINS, GOD FORBID and the Jagermeister Battle of the Bands winner; the Hot Topic stage will feature extreme metal bands CANNIBAL CORPSE, JOB FOR A COWBOY, BEHEMOTH, BLACK DAHLIA MURDER and WHITECHAPEL. The World’s Greatest Freestyle Motocross team METAL MULISHA will also be revving up the crowd with their unique style of death-defying motorcycle stunts on all dates.</p><p>The tour will see Manson and Slayer performing tracks from each of their long-awaited new albums. Manson will be playing “We’re From America” and lead single “Arma…geddon,” both from new album The High End of Low, in stores May 26th. The album was produced by Manson, longtime friend and foil Twiggy Ramirez and keyboardist Chris Vrenna. Manson fans will note that this is his first collaboration with Ramirez in close to a decade.</p><p>Slayer will tear through “Psychopathy Red” and other new material from their yet-to-be-titled new album. The band recently announced that “Psychopathy Red”–the band’s first new song since 2006’s Christ Illusion–will be available as a 7-inch vinyl disc beginning Saturday, April 18th, as part of the third annual Record Store Day. Only 5,000 of the limited edition discs will be manufactured worldwide, and they will be available exclusively at participating independent record stores (log onto www.recordstoreday.com for the list of participating retailers). Slayer chose to unleash “Psychopathy Red” on this day and only through independent record stores to acknowledge the support those outlets have offered to the band and to metal music over the years.</p><p>Killswitch Engage and producer Brendan O’Brien (Mastodon, Pearl Jam, Rage Against The Machine) recently wrapped production on the follow-up to 2006’s gold-certified release, As Daylight Dies. The band appeared on the cover of Revolver magazine’s 2009 preview issue and was praised by Alternative Press and Decibel for having “one of the most anticipated albums of 2009.”</p><p>Bullet For My Valentine are currently recording a new album with Don Gilmore (Linkin Park, Avril Lavigne) in London and Wales.</p><p>The Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival is co-produced by Live Nation and is the brainchild of Kevin Lyman, John Reese and CAA’s Darryl Eaton, the creative team behind some of the industry’s most successful road jaunts, including the long-running Vans Warped Tour and the Worldwide Rockstar Taste of Chaos Tour.</p><p>Following the proven model of utilizing sponsorship to deliver a lower ticket price and an enhanced concert experience, the tour organizers have joined forces once again with ROCKSTAR ENERGY DRINK, the festival’s title sponsor.</p><p>In addition to catching a slew of speaker-shredding performances, festival-goers can take part in a number of activities, including playing the newest video games, perusing vendors, attending autograph signing sessions and a host of other interactive activities that will add to the carnival-like experience.</p><p>The Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival is made possible through the support of title sponsor Rockstar Energy Drink and supporting sponsors Hot Topic, Jagermeister, Rockband 2, Hard Rock Cafe, Affliction, Revolver Magazine, Roadrunner Records, Metal Blade Records, Pick The Band Records, Prosthetic Records, the Shirts For A Cure Project, media partner Fuel TV and many more!</p><p>About Rockstar</p><p>ROCKSTAR is the world’s most powerful energy drink.

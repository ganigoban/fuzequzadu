I also saw that people were washing their hands and feet before entering the church just like it is done in Islam,” he added.</p><p>When the former pastor converted to Islam, about 150 of his congregation abandoned his church, and his decision was met with different reactions.</p><p>While some of his family relatives and friends respected his decision, the former pastor said that his wife was among those who opposed his choice.</p><p>“The only person who at the time opposed it was my wife, be­cause she was a Christian when I married her.”</p><p>However, many others who “have always known me to be truthful with whatever I’m doing,” respect him, adding that they “also respect my decision, so there hasn’t been any cause for alarm.”</p><p>The church, which used to be a Christian place of worship, has started to receive many Muslims looking for a good place to perform daily prayers.</p><p>Information from Morrocoworldnews.com was added to this report.</p><p>SOURCE: <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>www.Ghgossip.com</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqmYrKyfp3qku82vnKuso2LBsHnIrKOapV2pwrO60maaoa2imLVutc2tpmaln6i%2BtrGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

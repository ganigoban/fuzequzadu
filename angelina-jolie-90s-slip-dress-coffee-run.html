On Wednesday we were honoured to see two of Jolie’s impeccable outfits in one day as she took her daughter Zahara Jolie-Pitt for a day out.

Yesterday she was out in New York again and obviously, her outfit didn’t fail. She nailed the art of layering, and convinced us that we need to switch up our coffee run uniform ASAP (which is often jogging bottoms and bed hair).</p><p id=eAmIary_vXs data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Angelina Jolie just wore the most incredible cape and it’s giving us major Maleficent nostalgia</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ddf2405b6bca-angelinacoffee1z-z.jpg><p id=ecdijJuqalr data-wc=6><strong>Angelina's coffee run uniform is elite</strong></p><p id=ez1UPXPVNHvm data-wc=39>The Maleficent star wore a satin black slip dress to grab her takeaway coffee.

Does she seem like a vanilla latte kinda lady?&nbsp;</p><p id=ei2JMCbN5mwj data-wc=61>A satin slip has been on Jolie’s go-to style agenda for as long as she’s been under the close watch of sartorial eyes. From wearing a blue-silver version on the red carpet in 1997, to this Wednesday when she wore an ivory hued maxi <a class=hm-link href=#>with the most luxurious cape</a>, to yesterday. If there’s one reliable item to add to your wardrobe, this is undeniably it.</p><p id=eLOEItCy-6CZ data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Anya Taylor Joy wears classic 90s slip dress and it's all we want to try this winter</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c454a6603d1e-angelina11z-z.jpg><p id=eSuEk1o1wTZF data-wc=7><strong>She layered up with a v-neck jumper&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eA7u5mu6sebY data-wc=72>Yesterday she sensibly layered up to face the crisp New York weather, throwing a black v neck jumper over the top of her silky silhouette. She rounded off the all-black ensemble with a long wool coat and heeled boots. It seems Anthony Vaccarello is her current handbag designer of choice, as she donned a Saint Laurent tote with her ensemble – an oversized version of the clutch she used twice on Wednesday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bbee6a4877d9-cape1z-z.jpg><p id=eI_3qE__lMe5 data-wc=10><strong>She wore a champagne slip on Wednesday with daughter Zahara</strong></p><p id=e3VOX8cPBl4a data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Lily James is the ultimate It-girl in retro slip dress</a></strong></p><p id=ebPdiJJZC0JS data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Emily Ratajkowski's slip dress and mules combo is now our official summer uniform</a></strong></p><p id=eGBXZnBW1nMY data-wc=51>Though the Y2K influence has dominated the fashion industry for the last couple of years, satin slip dresses never really left us, it was just how we styled it that altered. Most notably the t-shirt-under-slip-dress era, as French brand Courrèges’ demonstrated this with a printed tee at its spring 2016 show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1038c56c91f6-courregesz-z.jpg><p id=er1qtMIRYMyh data-wc=8><strong>A satin slip look from Courreges SS16 show</strong></p><p id=e18sZr0I8LqG data-wc=48>We then reversed the layering and opted for the Parisian inspired, influencer favourite ‘t-shirt over slip’, often paired with crisp white trainers or boots.

In 1987, she was briefly replaced by Catherine Hickland while Lang was on sick leave. In 1997, Sandra Ferguson filled in for a small amount of time during Lang's maternity leave. In 2012, Lang announced that she had signed a two-year contract with the series, ensuring her stay until 2014. The world-wide success of <i>The Bold and the Beautiful</i> has meant world-wide controversy among fans for this most controversial of characters. As far away from the U.S.A. as Kenya, men heatedly condemn this "evil" and "wicked" woman, while women praise her for being "independent and put[ting] men where they belong." In 2013, she received her first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting <a href=#>Actress</a> in a Drama Series nomination her portrayal of Brooke after 25 years of joining the soap.</p><span>1995</span><p>Brooke later had a short marriage to a man named Grant Chambers in 1995 after her attempts at blackmailing Ridge into leaving Taylor for her failed, and she put Grant in charge of the company. In 1998, Taylor became pregnant with Ridge's child; however, she told everyone the baby belonged to Thorne after seeing who she believed to be Ridge in bed with Brooke. In reality, Brooke conned a drunken Ridge into her bed and Ridge rebuked her. Brooke later became interested in Thorne and overcame obstacles with him and his then wife, Macy. Macy was killed in a car accident, which Brooke survived. Thorne and Brooke parted ways, and she turned her attention back to Ridge, who was still married to Taylor. Brooke was later tricked by the Forrester family into traveling to Paris to keep away from the happily married Taylor and Ridge (who had since had twins, Steffy and Phoebe). After she came back, Brooke had an affair with her daughter Bridget's husband, Deacon Sharpe. Bridget was disgusted by this, and later Brooke gave birth to a daughter named Hope Logan as a result of the scandalous affair. Briefly during the pregnancy, she married a Forrester co-worker Whip Jones to cover up her adulterous affair.</p><span>2005</span><p>When Taylor was murdered by deranged nurse Sheila Carter, Ridge and Brooke found their way back to one another. Sheila returned and later held Ridge, Brooke and the <a href=#>Sailor</a> who arrived in L.A., Nick Marone hostage for ransom. Ridge was briefly presumed dead after falling into a fire pit, and Brooke slept with Nick while mourning. Ridge returned and Brooke later fell pregnant and gave birth to R.J. (Ridge Junior) Forrester. The baby was initially thought to be Nick's child, but later proved to be Ridge's. When Taylor returned from the dead In 2005, Stephanie Forrester faked a heart attack and asked for her dying wish to be Ridge and Taylor's reunion. Brooke moved out of Ridge's life, and began a relationship with Nick in 2006. She faced complications as Nick was also in an on-again, off-again relationship with her daughter Bridget. She and Nick divorced for the sake of Bridget's ill- fated pregnancy (the baby was stillborn). In 2007, Brooke tried to interfere with Ridge's relationship with Ashley Abbott. She left town after being practically pushed out by Stephanie, who had supported Ashley and Ridge's relationship.</p><span>2008</span><p>Brooke is the eldest of the Logan sisters. She studied chemistry during her early days in college. Brooke is the daughter of Beth and Stephen Logan, the elder sister of Donna Logan (Jennifer Gareis) and Katie Logan (Heather Tom), and the younger sister of Storm Logan (played by <a href=#>william</a> deVry at the time of the character's death in 2008). She worked for her family's catering family who often served rich pillars of the community (including the Forrester family).</p><span>2009</span><p>Brooke started to go after Nick again. When Taylor and Nick (together now) decided to have a baby, they needed an egg donor. After baby Jack was born, it was revealed that Brooke was the biological mother of the baby and the eggs were hers through a mix up. Taylor had an emotional breakdown and recovered, and decided to share Jack with Brooke so that the child could have a biological connection. In 2009, Taylor and Brooke began to fight for Ridge's affections once again after Taylor's relationship with Brooke's much younger son Rick. Taylor and Ridge married; however, he returned to Brooke shortly after. In 2010, Brooke repeated history, as she had once done with Deacon and Bridget, when she accidentally had sex with Hope's then-boyfriend, Oliver Jones, and like Bridget, Hope forgave her. In 2011, Brooke and Thomas, while on a <a href=#>Business</a> trip to promote Thomas' Taboo men's line at Forrester Creations, ended up stranded on an island. While stranded, Brooke and Thomas ingested poisonous berries as a means of survival. The berries planted the idea that Brooke and Thomas had slept together. When they returned home safely, Stephanie teamed up with Thomas together to come up with the lie that he and Brooke had sex on the island, in order to break up her marriage with Ridge. This allowed Ridge and Taylor to nearly remarry, until Stephanie revealed the truth, allowing Ridge to reunite with Brooke. Ridge proposes to Brooke in Italy. Stephanie offers to organise the wedding at her house; it was a simple ceremony with only family as guests. Ridge and Brooke leave for their honeymoon after the speeches have taken place. While on their honeymoon, Brooke is in touch with Deacon via text, and Ridge finds out, but when he asks Brooke about it, she denies it. Ridge tells Brooke he can no longer take the lies and tells her he will not be returning home with her. Brooke arrives home without Ridge to deal with Katie.</p><span>2010</span><p>In mid-2010, Taylor's (Brooke Forrester's nemesis) daughter Steffy Forrester began going after Hope Logan (Brooke's now teen daughter)'s boyfriends. This re-ignited both Taylor and Brooke's rivalry and began a new generation rivalry. <a href=#>Bradley Bell</a> stated on this: "is exciting to see Brooke and Taylor in the more maternal roles. Brooke has a daughter -- miraculously -- who is sweet and a virgin. She is just a darling; and Taylor has a daughter who is trouble. She knows how to manipulate men and she is very sexual [Like Brooke]". Of the character's "accidental" infidelity with her daughter's (Hope) boyfriend Oliver Jones, Lang stated: "She was excited and high on her hormones" during an interview with Michael Fairman. Hope began to become more like her mother when she became more sexual in her relationship with Liam's half-brother, Wyatt Spencer. And the fact that she was dating two half brothers, Liam and Wyatt, at the same time, just as Brooke did with Nick Marone and Ridge Forrester. Ivy Forrester kept stating Hope is a lot like Brooke and so did Stephanie.</p><span>2013</span><p>Brooke then finds herself caught between two men â€“ Bill and Deacon, who had recently returned to LA to be a part of Hopeâ€™s life. Brooke then leaves LA for three months to work in Milan, Italy. Upon returning, she decides that she wants to be with Ridge, but he rejects her to marry Caroline. Brooke then turns to alcohol, and Deacon helps her deal with it by attending AA meetings with her. Brookeâ€™s alcoholism resulted in her acting strangely at Bill and Katieâ€™s second wedding, and also began raising suspicions from Quinn, who was then involved with Deacon. Quinn found out about Brooke and Deaconâ€™s affair, and slapped her to the floor. Brooke then crashed Deacon and Quinnâ€™s wedding by bringing Hope in via Skype in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the ceremony. Brooke and Ridge became closer after he revealed to her that he had a vasectomy, and that Thomas was the biological father of Carolineâ€™s baby, Douglas. Katie decided to make amends with Brooke by offering her a job at Spencer Publications, which resulted in Bill and Brooke re-igniting their feelings. Bill and Brooke began to raise suspicions, causing Katie to begin drinking excessively. After Ridge manipulates Eric into kicking Rick, Maya and Nicole out of the Forrester Mansion, Brooke allows them to stay. Brooke began to resurrect her feelings for Bill but did not want to have an affair with him while married to Katie. Katie then found out about Brooke and Billâ€™s affair, resulting in a complicated divorce, with Katie receiving $50 000 000 from Bill, and the two sharing custody of Will. Bill promised Brooke his 12.5% stake in Forrester Creations, which Brooke would sell to Ridge in order to help him remove Quinn from the company. However, on the day of Brooke and Billâ€™s wedding, on Halloween 2016, Ridge stopped the wedding and won back Brooke after Bill left her at the altar. Ridge then proposed to Brooke at Stephanieâ€™s grave, and eventually the two found their way back to each other.</p><span>2017</span><p>In March 2017, the Forrester and Spencer families travelled to Sydney, <a href=#>Australia</a> for Liam and Steffyâ€™s third wedding. Ridge and Brooke decided to get married there as well, until Brooke discovered Quinn and Ridge kissing at a beach. Originally determined to tell Eric, Ridge and Quinn manipulated Brooke into keeping quiet, but broke off her engagement with Ridge. Brooke stayed in Sydney while everyone else returned to LA, and was comforted by Bill. Bill and Brooke finally marry in May 2017, and honeymooned in Paris.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>The Bold and the Beautiful characters</a> <a href=#>Fictional businesspeople</a> <a href=#>Fictional business executives</a> <a href=#>Fictional characters introduced in 1987</a> <a href=#>Fictional people in fashion</a> <a href=#>Fictional alcohol abusers</a> <a href=#>Fictional sexual assault victims</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeSp7ywt8Rmo6iml2K7psCMsKarrJhig3Z%2Fk28%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

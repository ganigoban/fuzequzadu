In a since-deleted Instagram post that went up in 2019 (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Vogue</a>), Kardashian is seen&nbsp;showing off her stomach while posing next to the Flat Tummy Co's products that she claimed helped her lose weight.</p><p dir=ltr>Actor Jameela Jamil called out the reality star's post in a long Instagram comment (via&nbsp;Teen Vogue). "If you're too irresponsible to: a) own up to the fact that you have a personal trainer, nutritionist, probable chef, and a surgeon to achieve your aesthetic, rather than this laxative product... and b) tell them the side effects of this NON-FDA approved product, that most doctors are saying aren't healthy," she wrote. "It's incredibly awful that this industry bullied you until you became this fixated on your appearance," Jamil continued, adding, "That's the media's fault. But now please don't put that back into the world and hurt other girls, the way you have been hurt."</p><p dir=ltr>Despite the controversy, Kardashian promoted the same company the following year. "Ok... I've posted with @flattummyco's Shakes in the past and YES, I also use a personal trainer and nutritionist, but THESE SHAKES WORK to help get your tummy back to flat," she <a href=#>tweeted</a>. The post wasn't received well, with <a href=#>Twitter users</a>&nbsp;writing things like "dude these things don't work and are toxic and not good for your system."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9ka4F3e9OhnGaln6jBbq%2FOp6urp6aav7S1wKVknJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKmqn5nCpMCMnZyapKNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

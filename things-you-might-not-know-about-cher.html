They appeared together for an environmental benefit called "Mothers and Others" and reunited in "Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again!" During the movie's premiere, Cher told Entertainment Tonight that they were still friends after all these years and that Streep was wonderful on their first film together, saying "She was unbelievable, because I had no idea what I was doing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAkGlqbGlfqbWqusasZLKnpWK6qrPHrWSnp6RiuK%2B71maYm6elqXqktMSrZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

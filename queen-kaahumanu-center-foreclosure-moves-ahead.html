U.S. Bank on Nov. 16 requested that management of the property be placed under a receiver, who manages, oversees, takes control of and operates the property.</p><img width=561 height=840 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2021/06/04055705/mtkaahumanu-center-6-2-21-561x840.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>A handful of shoppers wander the grounds of the Queen Ka‘ahumanu Center on Wednesday. The mall’s fate is in limbo after a judge granted a request to foreclose on the property, which will go up for sale.</p><p>A financial report by Parra in April showed that mall tenants owe more than $2.3 million. Some tenants who owe thousands of dollars are no longer occupying spaces at the mall.</p><p>The mall tenant with the highest outstanding balance is Fun Factory, a Hawaii-based family entertainment center chain, which owes $328,612, according to the April report. The Walking Company, a comfort shoe company headquartered in California, owes $123,082. Also, Pretzelmaker, a Global Franchise Group LLC company that specializes in hand-rolled pretzels, owes $100,873.</p><p>Steven Lau, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Fun Factory, said on Thursday that he can’t confirm the amount owed.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It is because of the COVID we are negotiating with the landlord for rental relief and we have not reached an agreement yet,”</span> he said.</p><p>The Walking Company and Pretzelmaker did not respond to a request for comment Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Stephanie Zimmerman, manager and general counsel for the mall owners, also cited the economic impacts of COVID-19 in discussing the mall’s situation.</p><p><span class=quotations>“The current ownership of QKC has held and operated the center for nearly 20 years and is very saddened by this situation,”</span> she said in a February email to The Maui News. <span class=quotations>“The impact of COVID-19 on the community has been very far-reaching, with many of our tenants shut down for long periods of time through no fault of their own.”</span></p><p>In its heyday, the mall, constructed in 1972, was bustling with movies, shops and food options. Weekend nights of the middle ’90s were filled with high schoolers who socialized near the balcony on the second floor that overlooks center stage. Performances, activities, farmers markets and nonprofit events at the mall provided central meeting places in previous decades.</p><p>However, the embattled property also became the scene of significant crimes in recent years, including a stabbing death March 18, 2018 in the second-floor bathroom near the Macy’s men’s store and another nonfatal stabbing on Oct. 12, 2012 in the second-floor restroom near the food court.</p><p>When the mall defaulted in June of last year, Maui’s retail stores were barely reemerging from mandated pandemic shutdowns that began months earlier. Mayor Michael Victorino allowed retail stores, including shopping malls, to reopen in May, and many remained closed well into June.</p><p>Last month Queen Ka’ahumanu Center had 86.5 percent occupancy with a total of 144 units and a gross leasable area of 571,010 square feet, according to the April financial report.</p><p>As with other commercial spaces, mall vacancies have been increasing over recent years, with intermittent reports that anchor tenants like Sears may close up shop.</p><p>Recent tenant closures have included Hallmark Cards Inc., a nearly 45-year mainstay that shut down in May.</p><p>* Kehaulani Cerizo can be reached at kcerizo@mauinews.com.</p><a href=#><img width=470 height=274 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2021/06/04055655/mt-kaahumanu-center-a-6-2-21-470x274.jpg alt decoding=async aria-describedby=gallery-4-858923 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Queen Ka‘ahumanu Center is shown Wednesday.

With the series finale of his latest show Bull already airing on CBS, Weatherly has some free time to return to Cameo.</p><p>Taking to social media, Weatherly announced that “just in time for Father’s Day,” he is back on Cameo. This is a sly way of suggesting that ordering a message from him would serve as a great Father’s Day gift this year.</p><p>Recently, NCIS executive producer Steven D. Binder&nbsp;spoke about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">possible return of Weatherly to the NCIS cast</a>. It certainly seems like something that has been discussed, along with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">possibility of Gibbs returning to help his former team</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Michael Weatherly returns to Cameo</h2><p>For NCIS fans who have not heard of Cameo, it is a site that allows people to order messages from celebrities. Those messages can then be catered toward a big event or something special going on in the lives of a person that they know.</p><p>As an example, if someone wanted to get a unique birthday gift for their significant other, they could order a personalized video from Michael Weatherly. The former NCIS star would then record the greeting based on what was requested, which makes for a pretty unique gift.</p><p>Weatherly’s messages are a tad on the expensive side, as he charges $199 for one of his videos on Cameo, but he also does advertise that delivery of those messages could take place within 24 hours.</p><p>Cameo is something that a lot of celebrities now use, giving them a unique way to make some extra money while interacting with fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More NCIS news and notes</h2><p>NCIS, NCIS: Los Angeles, and NCIS: Hawai’i all return for new seasons in the fall. CBS felt confident in renewing all three shows, and the expectation is that the new episodes will begin airing in September 2022.</p><p>During the downtime, NCIS fans can view all past seasons of the shows on Paramount+. This is a great place to stream some of the best episodes that featured Michael Weatherly playing Anthony DiNozzo, including all of the ones where his character’s relationship with Ziva David was developing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Some other great news that has come out is that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NCIS was named the No. 1 drama in the TV ratings</a>. It was a huge piece of news for the franchise, especially after the show had been moved to Monday nights.</p><p>NCIS airs Monday nights at 9/8c on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWimk57AbrLAp6pmm5Gjeqix02aknqujlrSmv4yfqailXaK2pLTAnqNmr5WWwamx0aWwZqeeYrCiucSoZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

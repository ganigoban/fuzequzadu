The series chronicles the life of Montana rancher John Dutton, who owns one of the biggest cattle ranches in the United States. He, along with his family, must protect the land, which is in constant conflict with those it borders - an expanding town, an Indian reservation, and America's first national park."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"But when it happens in a small area, in a rural area … and because there’s fewer people, the consequences seem much more acute."</p><p id=ett9cF6_gRGC data-wc=28>He continued: "When you start seeing Costcos in a landscape of farms and ranches, it's much more dramatic than if they jam one in the San Fernando Valley."</p><p id=eCBl_-d4ZpNb data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Yellowstone star Kelsey Asbille is dating a VERY famous British actor</a></strong></p><p id=elDrBfkcDX3L data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Yellowstone season 5's return and will there be season 6?</a></strong></p><p id=eByKWT6vKH7D data-wc=67>Taylor also said that the show is inspired by the "gentrification" of the West. "<strong>It is the most American of us, the West, and land developers sell that fantasy</strong>," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Deadline</a> back in 2018. "And people who can afford the fantasy are very, very wealthy people from LA to New York, Dallas and Florida.

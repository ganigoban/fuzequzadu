You might even think about <a href=#>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and his massive cheat day meals</a>. While Andy Samberg might not come to mind, perhaps he should because the star helped to create a burger that was named after him.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2014, the actor teamed up with Umami Burger, a chain that has also worked with Cindy Crawford, Jaden Smith, <a href=#>The Black Keys</a>, and Alton Brown. Appropriately deemed The Samberger, <a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;explains that the comedian's Chicago-style hot dog-inspired burger&nbsp;features "a beef patty topped with spicy sport peppers, roasted tomatoes, chopped dill pickles, relish made out of kombu (an edible kelp), roasted garlic aioli, poppy seeds, and yellow mustard."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"I worked tirelessly 'munchin around' with the Umami Burger team to design a burger that would best represent everything I stand for," Samberg shared, per <a href=#>EW</a>. Saying that they "tried many combinations and flavors, and ultimately landed on a Chicago Dog-themed burger," he noted, "[It] has literally nothing to do with me. But it tasted really good so we went with it."</p><p>Costing $13, the aforementioned outlets pointed out that $1 of that was going to be donated to the <a href=#>Center for Early Intervention of Deafness</a>. Although when <a href=#>Umami Burger brought some for the cast of "Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"</a> they probably let the actors have the food for free.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWxkboR1e9ahmK1lnaTAtXnPnqappJVisbC602aip6enYq6ju9StZJqmlK56tK3Mm5yrn18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

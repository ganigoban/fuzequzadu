"I'm also really loyal and love doing nice things for the people that are special to me," she says. "My love language is gift giving, so I'm a real giver when it comes to relationships."</p><p id=eu4uYkaRRNj data-wc=12>On what gives her 'the ick', she says: "Guys with no ambition.&nbsp;</p><p id=eTzDpSLoKWt data-wc=52>"I also get the ick if I see a guy wearing white jeans and red trainers. Another one is super skinny jeans when they look like leggings. Fashion is such an important thing for me. If I go on a date and the guy isn’t wearing something I like, I’m going home."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5e25f592e4f0-ruchee-love-island.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Tyrique Hyde</h2><p id=eQ2Z0HhSjbOe data-wc=47>24-year-old Tyrique is a semi-professional footballer who is planning to bring "vibes, confidence, good energy and honesty" to the villa. "I don't sit on the fence, if I have an opinion I will speak up. I'm also not afraid to go after what I want," he says.&nbsp;</p><p id=erYbriGHqnnA data-wc=28>The Essex-born sportsman is "best friends" with former Love Island star Toby Aromolaran, who appeared on season seven. The pair grew up together and attended the same school.&nbsp;</p><p id=eAcjIPNjh_q8 data-wc=41>One fact that he would like his fellow islanders to know is that he is deaf in his right ear. " I have a tattoo next to my left one that symbolises strength and power in my good one," he says.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ece37aef4dee-tyriue-love-island.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Molly Marsh</h2><p id=eBH3lpWrtQxg data-wc=68>Molly is heading into the villa this year in a bid to find 'the one' and believes the show is the "perfect way" to find someone. "I don't go out and party and I don’t use dating apps, I'm actually quite old-fashioned, so there's no better way to meet someone than by going into a Villa in the sun with the potential 'one' in there," says the 21-year-old.&nbsp;</p><p id=enu7CJ236C data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Coronation Street star's daughter set to star on Love Island – details</a></p><p id=eC2_ffCnbIpR data-wc=50>While Molly, who hails from Doncaster, is the daughter of <a class=hm-link href=#>Coronation Street actress Janet Marsh</a>, she's a star in her own rights as she works as a musical theatre performer, performing in several pantomimes.

"I want them to be passionate about something, whether it’s a job or enjoying trips to the zoo on Saturdays."</p><p id=eT372Kes03wN data-wc=41>He also admits: "I prefer a girl who is naturally good looking, and someone who has even more banter than me- although I don't believe that’s physically possible. I think those three qualities make for a perfect mix in a partner."</p><p id=eMKKiC7Xa94k data-wc=32>The 24-year-old, who works as a business development executive, says he's "the first person to bring the vibe up" and plans to bring his "dad jokes and dad dancing" to the villa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/61b808042f5f-george-love-island.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Catherine Agbaje</h2><p id=eS2UQxamgwuj data-wc=24>22-year-old Catherine is "always smiling, always happy and always laughing". The Dublin-based commercial real estate agent describes herself as "fun, flirty and never boring".</p><p id=eLovR_h6dFty data-wc=39>Although people usually assume her teeth are veneers, they are in fact real.

"I know what I want in life and I've got a big heart."</p><p id=ekH1iGTni8TZ data-wc=51>Love Island isn't her first screen debut as she previously appeared in a Headie One and Burna Burna Boy music video and I was once an extra in World War Z.

I'm also a really good girlfriend."</p><p id=eBpeBYi-HioC data-wc=33>On what gives her 'the ick', the 21-year-old says: "When a guy stunts for money, that’s an ick. Showing off all their designer clothes because most of the time they’re probably fake anyway!&nbsp;</p><p id=eExqv6v7gani data-wc=29>"Another one is when a boy runs for the train and the train goes without him. Lunch Boxes also - just go to Tesco and get a meal deal!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d3f572b809f7-jess-love-island-2023.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>André Furtado</h2><p id=eNMetqDs4lSs data-wc=41>Dudley-based André plans to bring his "good looks and some language lessons" to the villa this summer.

I think I've got every slice of the pie."</p><p id=eit7EbCkp7jk data-wc=37>The 21-year-old business owner added: "I would say I fall too quickly to be honest.

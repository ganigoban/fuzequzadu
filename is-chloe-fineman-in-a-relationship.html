In September 2020, she opened up to <a href=#>The Washington Post</a> about being in lockdown with him in Los Angeles. "Initially being quarantined with my boyfriend was like, 'Oh my God, are we going to kill each other?'" she said. "And then it kind of has turned into a beautiful rom-com."</p><p dir=ltr>In February 2022, the comedian mentioned her boyfriend in another interview, describing his distaste in his girlfriend trying out hair extensions. "My boyfriend didn't like them," she told <a href=#>Bustle</a>. "He was like, 'You feel like a doll.'"</p><p>And in May 2022, the "Saturday Night Live" star hinted that her relationship may be long distance at times. She talked to New York Magazine's <a href=#>"The Strategist"</a> about her favorite household things. "One of my favorite breakfasts is an English muffin, so I need a good toaster," she said. She then mentioned that she owns two toasters — a white one in New York and a red one in Los Angeles, "where her boyfriend lives." Although Fineman has a boyfriend, she actually joked about marrying her best friend during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlia4R0go6iqmabmKG8pnnFoqWepZGjeqq6jJpkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Do you need 13 hearts for Trial of the Sword?</h3><p>Yes, the sword will actually kill you if you have anything less than thirteen hearts and you still try to pull it out. You will only acquire it once you have at least thirteen hearts – when you try to pull out the sword then, it will almost kill you, but once it’s out of the ground, all your hearts will be restored.</p><h3>2. How many hearts should I have for Master Sword trials?</h3><p>You need a total of 13 full heart containers to pull the Master Sword in Breath of the Wild and start the trials.</p><h3>3. Can you save after beating the first 12 trials of the sword?</h3><p>No, you can only save after completing each round. There are three rounds in total – 12 Beginning Trials, 16 Middle Trials, and 23 Final Trials.</p><h3>4. When should you attempt Trial of the Sword?</h3><p>You need to have the Master Sword unlocked before you can play the Trial. Once you have it, put it back in its pedestal to start the trial. It is recommended to visit as many Shrines as possible beforehand to increase your hearts and stamina.</p><h3>5. Is there a lynel in the Trial of the Sword?</h3><p>Yes, there is a lynel in the Trial of the Sword. It is recommended to use Ancient Arrows to defeat the lynel easily.</p><h3>6. Can you take breaks in Trial of the Sword?</h3><p>Yes, you can take a break between each round of the Trial of the Sword. There are three rounds – Beginning Trials, Middle Trials, and Final Trials.</p><h3>7. How hard is the final Trial of the Sword?</h3><p>The Final Trials are arguably the most difficult challenge you’ll face in Breath of the Wild. They are even harder than the final fight of the game. It is recommended to polish your fighting techniques in the Beginning and Middle Trials before attempting the Final Trials.</p><h3>8. What is the final reward of the Master Sword trials?</h3><p>When you complete one series of trials, the Master Sword gains 10 attack points. When you complete the final series, the Master Sword will start glowing permanently – which means it is now in its upgraded state. This brings additional benefits like much higher durability and sword beams that don’t cost any durability.</p><h3>9. Why is the Master Sword only level 30?</h3><p>The reason the Master Sword deals only 30 damage and wears out so quickly when attacking “regular enemies” is because it had been broken and worn down a hundred years ago in the battles during the Great Calamity. It has lost its strength and is no longer able to perform at peak capacity.</p><h3>10. Can you use Wolf Link in Trial of the Sword?</h3><p>No, Wolf Link is not allowed in the Trial of the Sword. Other amiibos are also not allowed.</p><h3>11. Are the sword trials harder in master mode?</h3><p>Yes, the Trial of the Sword is definitely much harder in master mode. Especially the Beginning Trials, where you are given bad weapons and have strong enemies that can be challenging to defeat.</p><h3>12. Is it worth it to do the Trial of the Sword?</h3><p>Yes, it is definitely worth it to do the Trial of the Sword. The final reward is the True Master Sword, which has higher attack points and durability, making it a much stronger weapon.</p><h3>13. What happens if you fall at the end of Trial of the Sword?</h3><p>If you fall at the end of the Trial of the Sword, you will be placed back on firm ground with one heart deducted.</p><h3>14. What is the hardest floor in the Master Sword trials?</h3><p>In my opinion, the hardest floor in the Master Sword trials is Floor 10 from the Beginning Trials. It is surrounded by water, making it difficult to move, and you’re dealing with strong enemies without any armor.</p><h3>15. How many ancient arrows are in the final trials?</h3><p>There are a total of 9 ancient arrows in the final trials – 3 in the break room, 3 in an ice chunk, and 3 in a chest sunken in lava.</p><h3>16. Should I do the Trial of the Sword before or after Ganon?</h3><p>You can do the Trial of the Sword before or after defeating Ganon. It is up to your personal preference as it won’t make much of a difference.</p><h3>17. What is the strongest weapon in Zelda?</h3><p>The Master Sword remains the best weapon in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It has a base strength of 30 but can go up to 60 in certain areas and around specific enemies.</p><h3>18. Does the Master Sword run out of power in Totk?</h3><p>Yes, the Master Sword will run out of energy after a few hits in the Trial of the Sword. It will still be in your inventory but faded out on the weapons tab and require a cooldown.</p><h3>19. Is the Trial of the Sword glitch patched?</h3><p>Yes, the Trial of the Sword glitch has been patched in The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild version 1.3.1.</p><h3>20. What is the rarest Lynel?</h3><p>The rarest Lynel is the Silver Lynel, which is the most difficult to defeat.</p><h3>21. What happens if you shoot an ancient arrow at a lynel?</h3><p>If you shoot an ancient arrow at a lynel, it will be removed from the world with a flash of blue light, but it will not drop any ingredients or materials.</p><h3>22. What is the weakest type of Lynel?</h3><p>The weakest type of Lynel is the Red-Maned Lynel, although it is still a formidable enemy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWgmrGqrY6wn5qsXZ7AbsDHnmSmoZ6eura5jKGcmqqkqHqnu9Fmq6GdXam%2Fqq3LZqafZaSdsm6%2F1qipnWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

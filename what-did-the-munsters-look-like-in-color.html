This fact was hammered in by the greater <a href=#>success of "Batman: The Movie"</a>&nbsp;— which premiered at the same time. Cast members such as Butch Patrick, who played Eddie Munster, even cite "Batman" as the primary reason for the sitcom's demise (via the&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a>). In spite of the networks losing faith in both "The Munsters" and "The Addams Family" (which, according to <a href=#>MentalFloss</a>, was also canceled in 1966 for potentially similar reasons), new life had been breathed into both in the form of multiple post-cancellation films.</p><p>For some, however, this was not enough to satisfy their nostalgia. In 2015, there was a fan who did his utmost to see that the Munsters were, in his eyes, properly brought back to life (via <a href=#>The A.V. Club</a>). On his blog <a href=#>Pop Colorture</a>, digital artist Zachary Smothers details how he managed to faithfully re-color <a href=#>the cult classic show's</a> intro — inventing new techniques as he went along frame by frame to ensure his project looked as clear as possible. The result is a remarkable glimpse into what could have been if CBS had been willing to pay a bit more for color.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAlm1ob2tfrLWiwIydoJ1lpJ2ybrnUp6qtnaKoeq27zqRkpaGbmnqquoycpqWnomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The two could easily have met during an episode of MTV's Total Request Live, in which Orlando was interviewed by Vanessa.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d786e0b846f9-vanessa-lachey-orlando-bloom-z.jpg><p id=e7T4LRjGfWIl data-wc=9><strong>Vanessa reportedly dated Hollywood actor&nbsp;Orlando Bloom in 2005</strong></p><h3 dir=ltr>Nick Lachey</h3><p id=eo7Xuj4AkuFM data-wc=34>While Vanessa and her future husband, Nick Lachey, had previously crossed paths on TRL, it wasn't until she starred in his 2006 music video for 'What's Left of Me' that their relationship became romantic.&nbsp;</p><p id=eiuC0-LnrOoB data-wc=71>In 2017, the NCIS star told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Billboard</a>: "[The] video, which was on TRL, was the beginning of our relationship. That's what made it no longer friends and it got romantic. To the point that if you go back and look at the video when he came to premiere it, I was so nervous and so crushing [on] him that I didn't show up for work that day. I called in sick."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5c73e5fe0963-vanessa-lachey-nick-lachey-z.jpg><p id=eA4905fd0JA7 data-wc=7><strong>Vanessa and Nick started dating in 2006</strong></p><p id=epV8ufySPXpA data-wc=35>While <a class=hm-link href=#>the couple briefly called it quits in 2009</a>, after three years together, it didn't take long for them to reunite, with Nick telling Good Day Philadelphia: "I was single for a minute there, and then we've kind of patched things up."</p><p id=eyFiIOrozT96 data-wc=43>After popping the question in 2010, the rest is history! Just two months later, Vanessa and Nick also revealed that they were expecting their first child together, and on 15 July 2011, they tied the knot in an intimate ceremony with 35 guests.&nbsp;</p><p id=eTWrmW8ZUatj data-wc=6><strong>The couple married in July 2011</strong></p><p id=ehYM1AeogB7g data-wc=46>Years later and the couple are still happily married, and parents to three children. They also co-host the Netflix reality series, Love Is Blind Together. Speaking about whether they would have gravitated towards each other on the show had they ever met, Nick told his wife:</p><p id=elh53imOBST7 data-wc=28>"I would find you anywhere. I really do think we would've found each other. I think we would've gravitated to each other.

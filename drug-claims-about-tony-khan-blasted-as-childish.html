Eric Bischoff recently decided to speak his mind about the feud and shared his thoughts on the situation.</p><p>Tony Khan fired the first shot at Ariel Helwani on Twitter, after he saw the famous MMA journalist appear on an episode of SmackDown before Elimination Chamber. In response, Helwani referred to Khan as a “snowman,” which many believe was a reference to rumors about Khan using a white powdered substance that makes TK go zoom.</p><p>During a recent <a href=#>interview with Riju Dasgupta</a>, Eric Bischoff addressed the situation and criticized the claims against Tony Khan. In Easy E’s opinion, that move from Ariel Helwani was childish and unprofessional as well.</p><p>“That was a very childish, inappropriate thing to do. If you have first-hand, personal knowledge and you witnessed it? That’s fine, all bets are off. Say whatever you want to say. But to spread a rumor or perpetuate a rumor started by somebody else, simply to get attention on social media? I think is really immature and unprofessional.”</p><p>Tony Khan and Ariel Helwani’s feud seems to have died down for now, but you never know what can happen in pro wrestling. TK could always get a wild hair and decide that he wants to bury Helwani again whenever his Twitter fingers get itchy.</p><p>Ariel Helwani kept a professional demeanor throughout the entire situation. He carried on with his life, and didn’t revisit things after laying down that epic “snowman” tweet. Only time will tell what the future holds, but it’s doubtful Ariel Helwani will get much love from AEW in the future.</p><p>What’s your take on Tony Khan and Ariel Helwani’s beef?

He recalled doing so during an interview with VladTV that has been causing <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">all kinds of headlines</a> in recent days.

He claims he spoke with one of Porter's "closet friends" after her passing: "I just needed to know and I asked them, 'What do you think?' And this was one of Kim's closest friends and she said, 'Bonds, I would hate to think that he had something to do with it,' she said.'" From there, he recalled the friend detailing the days leading up to her passing and a time she wore an IV in her arm at a party.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-diddy-amp-kim-porter-host-white-party-in-the-hamptons>Diddy & Kim Porter Host "White Party" In The Hamptons</h2></span><p>EAST HAMPTON, NY - SEPTEMBER 02: Host Sean "Diddy" Combs and Kim Porter with their twin daughters D'Lila Star Combs and Jessie James Combs pictured at "The Real White Party" presented by Sean "Diddy" Combs at the Combs' East Hampton estate on September 2, 2007 in East Hampton, New York.

Instead, he says a friend told him it was just a children's book. "She didn't like the way that Puff controlled her and the way he controlled the money he would give her for the kids. So, she wanted to make sure-- her exact words were, 'This motherf*cker not gonna run my kids like this. I want them to have they own money like Russell and his kids have.' So, she was trying to build a foundation for them to have their own following." He concluded by saying that he thinks Diddy truly loved Kim and doesn't think he would've played a part in her death. However, he says in the wake of the latest allegations he can't definitively say either way.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-roger-bonds-speaks-on-diddy-amp-kim-porter>Roger Bonds Speaks On Diddy & Kim Porter</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The interview comes after CNN published footage of Diddy assaulting Cassie at a hotel in 2016. He eventually apologized for the incident a few days later.

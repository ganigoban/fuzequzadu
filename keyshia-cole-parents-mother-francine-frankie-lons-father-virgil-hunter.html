But behind her success lies a complicated and painful family history that she has shared with her fans through her music and reality shows. In this article, we will explore the lives of Keyshia Cole’s parents: her mother Francine “Frankie” Lons, who passed away in 2021, and her father Virgil Hunter, whom she met for the first time in 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Francine “Frankie” Lons: Keyshia Cole’s Mother</h2><p>Francine “Frankie” Lons was born on June 18, 1960, in Oakland, California. She had a difficult childhood and became addicted to alcohol and crack cocaine at a young age. She gave birth to Keyshia Cole on October 15, 1981, when she was 21 years old. The father of Keyshia was Virgil Hunter, a boxing trainer who had a brief affair with Frankie. However, Frankie did not tell Keyshia about her biological father and kept his identity a secret.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Francine-Frankie-Lons-Keyshia-Coles-Mother.jpg><p>Frankie was unable to take care of Keyshia due to her addiction and financial problems. She gave up Keyshia for adoption when she was two years old. Keyshia was adopted by family friends Leon and Yvonne Cole, who changed her last name to Cole and raised her as their own daughter. Frankie remained in contact with Keyshia but was often absent from her life.</p><p>Frankie struggled with substance abuse for decades and went to jail several times for drug-related offenses. She also had six other children from different relationships: Sean Cole (also known as Nutt-So), Neffeteria Pugh (also known as Neffe Pugh), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elite Noel</a>, Sam, Zayya, and Kaela. Frankie tried to reconnect with Keyshia and her other children and sought help for her addiction. She appeared on several reality shows with Keyshia, such as Keyshia Cole: The Way It Is (2006-2008), Frankie & Neffe (2009), and Keyshia & Daniel: Family First (2012).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>However, Frankie’s recovery was not easy and she relapsed many times. She also faced health issues such as diabetes and kidney failure. In 2020, she celebrated 60 days of sobriety after checking into a rehabilitation facility in January. Keyshia supported her mother’s efforts and expressed her love for her on social media.</p><p>Sadly, Frankie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">passed away on July 18, 2021</a>, at the age of 61. She reportedly overdosed on drugs while celebrating her birthday at her home in Oakland. Keyshia confirmed the news on Instagram and wrote a heartfelt tribute to her mother. She said that she was “devastated” by the loss and that she would “never forget” her mother’s love.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Virgil Hunter: Keyshia Cole’s Father</h2><p>Virgil Hunter is a renowned boxing trainer who has worked with world champions such as Andre Ward, Amir Khan, and Andre Berto. He was born on August 31, 1954, in Oakland, California. He had a brief relationship with Frankie Lons in the early 1980s and fathered Keyshia Cole. However, he did not know about his daughter until much later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Virgil-Hunter-Keyshia-Coles-Father.jpg><p>Keyshia grew up believing that Leon Cole was her biological father until she learned the truth from Frankie when she was an adult. She then embarked on a quest to find her real father and took several DNA tests with different men who claimed to be related to her. None of them matched until she finally found Virgil Hunter in 2016.</p><p>Keyshia met Virgil for the first time when she was 34 years old. She shared the news on Instagram and said that she was “speechless” and “excited” to meet him. She also said that he was a “great man” who welcomed her with open arms. Virgil also expressed his joy at meeting his daughter and said that he was “proud” of her achievements.</p><p>Keyshia and Virgil have since developed a close bond and spent time together in Oakland and Las Vegas. They also attended boxing events together and supported each other’s careers. Keyshia said that meeting Virgil filled a void in her life and that she felt “complete” as a person.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Keyshia Cole’s parents had very different roles in her life. Her mother Frankie was a troubled woman who loved her daughter but could not raise her due to her addiction. Her father Virgil was a successful man who did not know about his daughter until later in life. Keyshia had to overcome many challenges and hardships to become the star that she is today. She also had to deal with the loss of her mother and the discovery of her father. Through it all, she remained strong and resilient and showed her fans that she is a survivor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGilnq%2BjZLimxdKhoJplk6S5pnnPmqmepqSoeq6706Gcq2WWp66vr8innGaeopa7rLXEZqOopqNis6LAx56pZq6Zp7SquIyhrKeslad8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

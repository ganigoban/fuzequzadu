As someone who doesn't star in blockbusters (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>and likes to eat</a>), seeing the collections is as close as I'm going to get — but if you want some attainable luxury and a dewy, glowing face à la Chanel ad, shoppers say the brand's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hydra Beauty Micro Crème Ultracalming Serum Concentrate</a> does the trick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike your typical fluid, watery serum, the Concentrate is an aqua-colored confection with a unique gel texture. Per reviewers who dub it the "ultimate layer of hydration for skin," it instantly delivers a juicy drink of moisture to their skin, and the aftermath is something to be seen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The best thing about the product is that it really works," writes a 66-year-old fan. "I saw a beautiful difference in two days, and after a week, I'm happy with the firmness on my face. Large pores are unnoticeable, or just gone." While it's unlikely that pores up and moved out (evolution worked hard on them), anything that can make you look retouched IRL is worth its weight in gold, or at least Chanel stock.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$98; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">chanel.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This light creme packs a powerful punch of hydration for such a lightweight texture. I use this after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the Micro serum</a> or the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Le Blanc serum</a>, and my skin has never looked more radiant," says a shopper. "I'm so glad I found this gem." Other people add that they've never been as excited about a moisturizer before, a feeling aided by the "terrific" base layer it creates for makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And let's be clear: When you're paying $98 for skincare, the quality has to be there. That much is assured for the Micro Crème, per satisfied customers. "I love this moisturizer. As soon as it hits my skin, I feel indulgent. Chanel keeps my face healthy and young," one person says. Another terms it "amazing" for women in their 40s, specifically, since the hydration lasts for hours.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The lasting effect traces back to the "patented micro-drop technology" at work in the formula, which keeps the concentrated camellia oil extract preserved until it hits your skin and starts plumping. The oil frequently shows up in Chanel's skincare — camellias are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the brand's signature</a> — as well as in products from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">famed haircare brand Shu Uemura</a>, which relies on the essential lipid-packed oil to nourish hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Less pertinent to hair than skin, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>one study</a> also found the flower's oil inhibited discoloration. The Chanel Micro Concentrate also features camellia flower extract, ginger root extract, jojoba oil, and shea butter for added moisture, along with vitamin E for antioxidants and wrinkle smoothing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Those additions culminate in a moisturizer that wins devotees, and they're as in-love as anyone who's saved years for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a quilted bag</a>. One writes, "The best moisturizer I have ever used. Hands down."

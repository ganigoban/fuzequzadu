I needed a pair of sandals that were comfortable enough for all-day wear and could withstand all the summer extremities&nbsp; — including chlorine-and-salt-water, grainy sand-coated toes (sorry). Sure, I could have gone with some of the other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>supermodel-beloved slides</a>, including the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>uber-popular Birkenstock Evas</a>, but I wanted something a little more unique and polished, and on first glance, the Freedom Moses slides checked both boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $50; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The slides are available in <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">tons of colors and patterns</a>, from neutrals and bold brights to majorly attention-grabbing animal prints and whimsical tie-dyes. I am an incredibly indecisive individual, so choosing a single color from the appealing range of offerings was tough. With versatility in mind, I opted for one of the many neutral glitters and have zero regrets. When I took them out of the box, there was one major surprise: The buckle is faux. For me, this has never been an issue in terms of fit or comfort. Like the similar Birkenstock style, the Freedom Moses sandal offers a molded footbed. However, there is an added feature I really appreciate: A cross-hatched insole. This keeps your feet from sliding around, even when wet. The sole also offers great grip, so again, no slipping around, even on the sidewalk.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $50; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The slide is also incredibly lightweight, which is because they are “injected with air,” according to the brand. And, because I am still a kid at heart, the fact that they are infused with milk and honey-scented oils is another major selling point.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">New York City-based stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Samantha Brown</a> gives the Freedom Moses a big stamp of approval. “I love a pair of rubber Birkenstocks, but Birks can feel a little bit chunky on the foot,” she tells InStyle. On the flip side, flip flops “can feel flimsy,” she adds. “These are a great beach or pool alternative that’s still waterproof. They’re very comfortable and substantial enough to walk around in when sightseeing or shopping,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I was sort of iffy about whether this vegan PVC sandal could be worn for hours on end, but they immediately became my go-to for everything from beach and pool days to city strolls. I also questioned their longevity, as most flip-flops and plastic-type shoes tend to have a shelf-life of a single summer season. However, after two years of wear, my first pair has experienced very little tear. That’s not to say I haven’t felt the need to add to my Freedom Moses collection; this season I was gifted a pair for myself and my 7-year-old daughter, who opted for a pink and white heart print, and now we’re twinning.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Convinced you need your own pair? (You do.) Grab your <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">favorite color (or two) at Amazon</a>; select colors and sizes are already selling out ahead of summer.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $50; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xaucnpyfonquu9KeqmarnJ6xpr%2BMmqSasp%2BjerOx1aKcsGVnan10hZBt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

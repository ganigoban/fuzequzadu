During a February 2020 interview with <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, Burrows explained, "And that's just one person – I mean, there was a culture. If someone was very powerful, most of their actions weren't questioned. The fact that some companies are now having transparency in their pay structures is revolutionary. It shouldn't be, but it feels revolutionary if you've come from an era where it wasn't like that."</p><p>With so many changes going on in the industry, how has the star kept afloat all these years?

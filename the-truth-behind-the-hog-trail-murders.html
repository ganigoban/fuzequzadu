Dan asked Burden if he needed work, and told him to get in his car. There, he offered Burden $120 to go with him into the woods and take nude photos. Burden needed cash so he agreed, but said absolutely no sex stuff, according to court documents.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, he said, Dan tied the ropes loosely as he took Polaroids, but then claimed it didn't look right and he needed to make the ropes tighter. Burden realized that he could not move his arms. Then, Dan began to fellate Burden, and when Burden didn't show arousal, Dan got mad and started strangling him with a rope. Burden said he was able to turn his head to the side so that he could still breathe.&nbsp;</p><p>The struggle ensued for about 20 minutes, with Burden going limp sometimes, per court records, and Dan attempting to penetrate him. Burden said Dan told him to "give up and let me do my job," but ultimately, it was Dan who gave up.</p><p>&nbsp;According to the court records, Burden told investigators he thought Dan was worn out. Dan said he'd give Burden $100 to keep his mouth shut about the incident, but never did. Instead, he left him tied to that tree to die. Burden was able to get free, but he did not go to the police.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FmGptcmpfqbWmedOrrK2gXZeyqbXNnWStoJVitbCzjK2pmqGcYrq2vsOeqaxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

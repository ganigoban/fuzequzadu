One story, a translation of Wace's writing by Layamon, claims that the table held around 1,600 knights, while other stories say it was a dozen. So, yeah, there have been a whole lot of Arthurian knights over the years and, for some reason, they were disproportionately titled with names that begin with the letter G: Gawain, Galehault, Gaheris, Gingalain, Griflet, etc.</p><p>The only other G name that's really notable would be Galahad, Lancelot's son, who picks up the knight Percival's quest to find the Holy Grail after his father failed. He only succeeded because he was a pure soul.</p><p>The Knights of the Round Table, as a whole, had one greater, collective personality and sense of virtue, making the legends a kind of reinforcement for courtly codes of conduct, like the code of chivalry, according to Arthurian Legends, the website about all things King Arthur. Stories like the legends of King Arthur with his Knights of the Round Table are prime examples of how nobility should behave and helped reign in the violent types of behavior that were often seen in the <a href=#>Middle Ages</a>. Stories and myths have been used in this way for as long as humans have had language, and it's pretty cool that the Knights of the Round Table have been — and continue to be — part of that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BlXFoaWhfrLWwedaeqZ5lpJ2ybrfNop6hrKNivKd506GcZqqfqruledOamaWdXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

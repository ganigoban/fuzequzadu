Earlier today she shared a post from Instagram with with no caption. The first picture was just a simple selfie that doesn't particularly say much of anything on its own. But attached to it is a that clearly speaks a lot to Doja's mentality right now. Her answer to a lot of the hate she's been receiving appears to be that she could turn back into her evil self at any time.

"If Anyone was about to comment something rude ab doja just don't say anything at all , it ain't worth it y'all , leave her alone," one of the top comments reads. On top of people defending Doja, the comments are also full of fans expressing fondness for her new music. "The only thing she sold was a record your honor," another one of the top comments reads. Though the announcement of the Billboard 200 has been delayed this week, Doja has a chance to place her new album inside the top 5. She also just debuted her new single "Agora Hills" in the top 20 during the same week "Paint The Town Red" <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">returned to the number one spot on the charts.</a> Check out Doja's Instagram post below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-doja-cat-says-she-s-this-close>Doja Cat Says She's "This Close"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Doja Cat's new album didn't hold much of anything back.

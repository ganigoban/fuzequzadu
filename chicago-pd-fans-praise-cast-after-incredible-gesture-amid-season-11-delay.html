The calculation is complex and can change depending on initial contract, length of time an actor has had guild membership, and the type of production. As an example the cast – Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and Matthew Perry – receive 2% of the syndication revenue for their hit WB show, meaning their annually bring in around $20million each. But as streaming services such as Netflix continue to refuse to share ratings, it makes it unclear how often content is played and it lowers an actor's residual calculation.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5de9FAHP4Y>The SAG and Writers Guild of America members are also both fighting AMPTP over protections for their work against Artificial Intelligence, and fears that technology would replace humans.</p><h2 dir=ltr>When will Chicago P.D season 11 be released?</h2><p id=ePJbCQ3nmur data-wc=12>Production on season 11 has been delayed due to the ongoing strikes.&nbsp;</p><p id=eunreQK4-zs data-wc=22>While new episodes of all the One Chicago shows usually air in the fall, they will likely now be <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>broadcast in 2024</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMzR9TzRe3f data-wc=20>LaRoyce Hawkins <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>gave an update on production</a> in July while appearing at an acting masterclass lecture at Louisiana State University.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e96706b9fdec-chicagopd.jpg><p id=eH2fDFQekkP data-wc=36>"Naturally, after the writers strike, it's going to take the writers a while to start warming up their rooms again and starting to conceptualize stories again," he said.
